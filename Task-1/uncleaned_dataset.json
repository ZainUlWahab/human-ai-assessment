        "content": "our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"pm me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nwe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  we're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nour new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  it will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###summary###\n\n**anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (i.e. pms, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"pm me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. and it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **by posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the op. if your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [the 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* people who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** this is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  it's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  it's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a pm conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch moderators to help**.  (contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police pms.)  \n\n* in our observation over many years, the people who say \"pm me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  community input mitigates these limitations. **there's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  if helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  these people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* if ops want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. although we don't recommend it, we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support. if you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them.",

        "content": "i\u2019m everyone\u2019s friend but no one is my friend female 24, i have multiple friends that consist of 1 year of knowing them to 8 years of knowing them. i have multiple \u201cfriend groups\u201d yet i feel alone. i have my main group of friends and we have been friends for about 7-8 years. it is 6 of us and lately i have not talked to them or seen them. i tried talking to them and it seems like they don\u2019t answer. i know they love and care for me but i feel like we are not friends anymore. my best friend seems to talk to me when she needs something. i feel like i am also so blame since they have invited me to go out or go to the gym but due to my depression, i say yes at first but then cancel the last minute. this is due to the insecurity and being the \u201cduff friend\u201d of the group. i miss them so much but it seems akward when i\u2019m around them. and they get along with each other pretty well. my next friend group are my ex coworkers from my previous job, realistically it is just one girl and i love her to death we get alone pretty well and i consider her my closest best friend. i usually call her when i need help with my panick attacks and we just click. she still works at the previous job and talks to all of our co workers there. i know the people she hangs out a lot at work and lately they have gone out a lot and at first they invited but again i would say yes then cancel this is due to my son  and mom making me feel bad. i always want to make plans with her to go on vacation and she keeps saying that she needs to save up for a car but then mentions that her other friends want to go on vacation and she is going. it seems like she makes them a priority and i don\u2019t mind but it makes me feel alone. last \u201cfriend\u201d group is my current job. i currently work for cps and i have coworkers in my unit. at first it was fine but now it seems like they see me as the dumb co workers. they make fun of me a lot and make me feel dumb. this would include my supervisor we see each other as a \u201cfamily\u201d so we play with each other a lot. i do believe that i would be very playful but i now feel like it\u2019s gotten to far. it does not help that main reason for my depression is this job. i feel like everyone in that job thinks i\u2019m weird and dumb. i am super loud and i feel like everyone thinks  i am too dumb to do this job. overall i feel like each one of the groups i am in my life have each other and in each group i am just there.   i feel like i\u2019m the ugly friend because within all these groups they are all pretty and social and i am the opposite of that. at the end i feel like i am just the floater and i don\u2019t have someone, i feel lost and alone.

        "content": "how i\u2019ve been feeling hi , i just wanted to say sum things i need to get off my chest . first of all, i hope everyone is having a wonderful day,  you don\u2019t really need to care or read the entire post , i\u2019m just trying to help the most ppl possible and also trying to learn how to feel a little bit better being in my skin :)\n\nmost importantly, sometimes i feel like i could be a burden or an outcast to my family, friends and my partner. the reason i might possibly feel this way is because the times i\u2019m with them , they seem to not really care or acknowledge my presence . btw  i\u2019m the second oldest child of five , so i might not be acknowledge at all sometimes by my family. don\u2019t get me wrong no matter what i will always love and care for  my family, friends and partner; but i feel like they don\u2019t really seem to care about me at all sometimes. i know that it seems a little far fetched on what i\u2019m saying but it feels that way , well i feel that way. mmmm well i am boring and a lil uninteresting , maybe that could be the reason why i feel that they seem not to care. who knows it could be a lot of reasons why , but i don\u2019t really care . i feel like it\u2019s got to a point where i don\u2019t really care , i feel like i could love  someone even though they don\u2019t  love me back. \n \ni felt and been alone most of my life , doesn\u2019t really mean that i would prefer to be alone but i think it\u2019s better that i am . i\u2019d had to learn a lot of things by myself and obviously i\u2019d had done some mistakes but i think it\u2019s a lot better to learn by yourself. i\u2019m not  saying that everyone has to learn by themselves but it\u2019s better and it feels good when you do learn something new yk ,when you do it yourself. it\u2019s nice to be alone sometimes , it\u2019s relaxing and peaceful but it could really mess with someone mentally. for example, i was all alone for an entire summer break once, i knew i could spend it with my family or friends but i decided to be alone , i wasn\u2019t really in a good mental state at that time so i just really wanted to be alone . it felt nice being alone at the beginning of the break, it was relaxing cuz i was finally taking a break from school , but when i started to see my friends on social media posting themselves hanging out with each other, it got to me.\ni think i got worse mentally , i started overthinking , my anxiety got worse , i felt back into depression. i think i had depression previously but it really  didn\u2019t feel as bad as this time, i really started to think about ending myself . the whole break was like a nightmare , sometimes i used to feel like i wasn\u2019t real. i don\u2019t know how to explain it but sometimes i\u2019d realize what was my purpose in this world , imagining a world without me , how would i family be without me. i really thought i was going insane , some a moment i forgot how to interact with ppl . for those wondering, i lived with my father at the time , my brother used to live with us  but he moved in with my mother. my brother used to always argue with my father, it just disappointed me cuz we didn\u2019t really go out all together. for context, there was a time when i lived with my father for a while , at the time my brother was deported to mexico along with my mother. long story short,  i didn\u2019t see them  for a really long time, the rest of my siblings  and i are us citizens so we could go see them when we wanted to .  i did see them in 2020 during lockdown , a year after they got deported, it was so happy seeing them again. after that, my father told me that he too misses my brother , so he decided we will go see them again next year but this time we will live there. i was shocked when he told me but at the same time happy . btw my parents are divorced, and the rest of my siblings are actually half-siblings . i\u2019m so sorry for going off track here\ud83d\ude05, mmm where was i.  oh yea, when we got  here i was happy we were going to together again but i dad realized my brother changed he was older from the last time he saw him. \nmy father didn\u2019t like this version of my brother , i was sad but i couldn\u2019t do anything, i felt bad when he moved out . i always thought he didn\u2019t really like to be around us so i just accepted it , he told me he was tired of my dad. \n\numm i think i\u2019m going too much off track , might edit sum stuff out. to be honest, this might be a dumb idea of a post.\n\np.s.   this part of the post is 4 months later from since i started writing this.\nsome things changed since then, i think i\u2019m getting sick; i might be getting worse .\ni don\u2019t know why i feeling this way again, i feel like i\u2019m trying to hard to fit in with people. i\u2019m was considering moving out after finishing school, i don\u2019t know where yet but i really need to leave. i\u2019ve been overthinking again , i don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me; i feel like i fuck everything up. i don\u2019t know why but my dad is being such asshole to me. probably it\u2019s just me realizing he\u2019s always been this way, this is probably how my brother felt . \ni haven\u2019t been eating well nor sleeping well either, this might be my all time low. those \u201cthoughts\u201d haven\u2019t cross my mind yet if you know what i mean. \nbefore i post this i want everyone to be that you actually have no one but yourself , take care .

        "content": "i need help this is my first time ever even attempting at maybe getting peer advice on my current mental state. i\u2019m a 23 year old male that\u2019s currently a rural emt, and i am as well in paramedic school, my problems start in my teen years with a drug addicted mom and a very stressed and angry home, while all being in extreme poverty. this made getting through school a complicated and hard process, and because of my situation i was bullied through a majority of my school career until 10th grade when i met a great group of friends and a girl that was the one maybe, she made life changing impacts on me, she gifted me clothes and fed me, she had done so much kindness towards me, that until this day i couldn\u2019t accurately describe it, life went on and the family and financial struggles continued, i was able to land a clerk job after graduation then later a dry cook job that paid more, this girl i spoke of staying by my side throughout the duration, my father, one of the best men to ever live on this planet died in 2023 on a emergency room operating table from bleeding to death due to failure of proper balloon placement because of an active heart attack he was having, he let the heart attack carry on for too long so by the time he reached the hospital his arteries became easily tore every time a balloon was placed. that night i felt so worthless and while sobbing walking out of the hospital into the rainy night i swore from that night on i would do whatever possible to prevent further death or harm to people, that\u2019s why i\u2019m currently doing the job i\u2019m doing, after he died in me and this girl moved into an apartment together, i was still a fry cook and was trying to figure out how to get into emt school. as for the apartment we remodel it, her being a huge cat person, i adopted two beautiful cats, also during this time my mom became worse off on drugs because of dads death. this girl and mines relationship had its times of arguments since the highschool era, and they worsened because of me. i was projecting the emotions of my dads death on her and that wasn\u2019t fair, things kept escalating to the point where one night i came home and it was early january of 2024 and she told me that she didn\u2019t love me, that i didn\u2019t make enough money and that she has been cheating on me with her coworker for months\u2026 i was absolutely devastated, she left and went to her mothers, things got ugly about certain property and we ended up in court with me winning what was mine but i had to leave the apartment since the lease wasn\u2019t in my name, i was now homeless in a blizzard, very suicidal, which i have always dealt with that challenge in life, to make a long story short my brother saved me by letting me couch surf and use his place as an hq to get my emt, until this day though i\u2019m haunted by all the bad things that has happened to me, but also by all of the bad things that i have done, i have nightmares, it\u2019s almost like her ghost won\u2019t let go of me and i\u2019m suffering, at the end of it all, i think that there were times i could have been more understanding and mature, more times that i could have listen rather than speak, i think we were two young people being out in the world for the first time and that and my dads death just overtook us, it all feels so unfair but life is unfair, i can\u2019t really seek professional mental help as i fear for my job, because i love what i do and it\u2019s in honor of my dad, i don\u2019t want to die but i don\u2019t want to live, my heart aches loudly for all that i have loss and i hope to maybe reunite with all that has fallen one day i hope, as for her and i that is for sure over and history, out of all of this i realized that we are all heroes in one person story but a villain in another\u2019s, if you took the time to read this far thank you, i have had all of this on my chest for years ",

        "content": "burned out well where do i start. \n\nfor starters im 27m. i am currently a it mgr (by title only) plus i do uber and side jobs just to survive (more on that later). i am currently single with a long history of heartbreaks one of which has been hurting for almost 3 years now. i am almost $100k in debt with a car that i am 20k upside down in plus multiple credit cards that have been charged off and i am just waiting to get hammered by debt collectors and or sued. all my hopes and dreams that i had growing up are completely and utterly destroyed by my own doing. i have my parents that count on me heavily and recently unloaded the house i grew up in on me despite my financial hole but could not decline either because of the great deal it is in my area. my job that i have held for 7 years 4 of which in my current role in it has been draining me in every way from it having been a backwards promotion with 3 paycuts and possibly a 4th coming, i have had essentially every authority and respect that i had get stripped from me for no reason other than me being the guy that took care of everything and handled the issues that were headaches for others and despite all this i cannot leave this place out of fear of not being able to find a similar job in my area and my heavy loyalty to the gm/owner of my company. the only joy and relief i get comes from my for lack of better words 2nd family who helped me out years ago when i had issues at home and took me into their home where i regarded them as my best friends they are husband and wife plus their daughter became my goddaughter who without a doubt is one of the most precious beings i have in my life and has been the most consistent bright thing in my life for the last 5 years however she is entering her teenage era which as most of us know means that she is drifting apart from some of the people in her life which i can't even be upset at because its a part of growing up. (sidenote as much as i love them they are very toxic and at times have made me feel very low but at the end of the day i still love them despite how rough the make me feel at times but the comfort and joy that i receive from them still outweighs that). i have really only 3 hobbies which are hiking with my dog whom i got a year ago to be my consistant hiking companion but because of all my financial issues i am hardly ever able to do so and he is also paying the consequences by being alone all day with me gone 14-16 hours a day. i also like shooting and road trips both of which i can hardly ever afford to do because again of financial issues and time constraints. in short i am running on empty with no bright light or happy ending in sight. my solution to everything for the last year has been just work and grind harder which i'm at the point where i have hit that limit. most days i feel so exhausted that i can barely get out of bed and once i do i just dread the day regardless of what day of the week it is. the other part of it is yes i have severe depression which is only encouraged by my daily reminders that it is what it is and seeing everyone around me do and get better plus i am very much against going to therapy i have nothing against for those that do it but i will not. i am also very lonely romantically and have had one after another of failed relationships or situation ships for the last 3 years all kicked off by me getting the mother of all heartbreaks by a woman who i thought was the great angel that ever lived and treated me like the greatest man that ever lived with not a single red flag in sight. after she left i was a complete and utter mess that was beyond broken and hurt and took me months to dig myself out of that hole which once i did kicked off a whole bunch of these other issues. so now here i am just struggling to keep moving with no end goal in sight. at this point i can honestly admit that the only reason i am still breathing is because of the fear of what pain this would cause my mother and father and my other loved ones so to make it clear i am not a danger to myself or anyone else for that matter but as far as any reasons or goals for myself to stick around for there are none at this time and i don't see any coming anytime soon. so yeah this was my brief reddit rant about all this shit. i could go into far more detail but at this time i don't see any reason to maybe down the line i might clarify more. thank you for listening. and for the record i am not looking for sympathy or anything of the sort this is me venting to a audience where there is a near zero chance anyone will know who i am.

        "content": "difficult times tw: self-harm/suicide\n\nfor the past day and a half, i've been feeling like how i did before taking antidepressants; fucking terrible. idk what happened - yesterday was good, nothing bad has happened to me this week, but here comes the pain train out of nowhere as soon as i got home yesterday.\n\n frankly, i don't remember all that much. i remember playing ghost recon for a few hours listening to music, then got super exhausted and tired. i remember jerkin' it a little too hard, causing a minor friction burn. the most severe things i remember are the following: \n\ni browsed r/selfharm and r/selfharmscars. i don't know why i did, i've never even struggled with sh and i know that it's terrible, but i've noticed an urge to cut after visiting those subs. i visited them this morning too. i know it won't help, but there's an urge.\n\n other thing i remember is being really thirsty, only having access to lemonade and sun drop, and i had the urge to relapse on soda. lemonade has been fine for a couple weeks, but it's not good enough. i don't want to relapse on soda, but i'm not left with many other options.\n\non top of this, i've been dealing with stress and anxiety from college despite being a high school senior. i want (i think) to become a psychologist - scratch that, i need to become a psychologist. that's my dream, i was promised that i can reach that dream, and its the main reason why i keep going. if i don't become a psychologist, i will die.\n\nmy ocd has gotten worse in the past couple of days; it took me 20 minutes to get in the shower because i was fulfilling compulsions. i'm never the type to seek reassurance, but i have been doing that in an unexpected way; making sure my grammar is perfect. it's not as bad in a reddit post, but half of my time in english yesterday was spent looking up \"when to use commas vs semicolons\" or \"do you quote paraphrases\", and i know that you don't but i can't stop making sure, damnit!\n\nthe anxiety portion of ocd has manifested as political anxiety; there's a terrorist in the white house. it's gotten betterish, but it does still impact my life. i'd go further into detail on that, but the last time i did that i got a warning, so.\n\ni've been abusing my vyvanse lately, i'm embarrassed to admit. 30mg daily, took 150mg on monday and yesterday. i just get so fucking bored at school cuz by the time the teacher says what to do, i've already done it. no cell service save a few hotspots (not allowed to have phones out in class anyway), only have one friend in one class, and jetpunk is only entertaining for so long. i can't not do work, seldom am i entertained by doing anything but work. i often dread weekends, and summer is awful. the more vyvanse i have, the less bored i am, thus the less anxious i am.\n\nsorry for the long post, i'm going through the \"dump all of your problems onto reddit\" stage. not that i have many other options; no hobbies, very rarely hang out with friends after school, no therapist (college offers free therapy, so i feel bad going right now rather than be patient), i know that my parents will support me; but i'm not quite ready to ask them for help yet, and friends either dgaf or don't know how to help. \n\nit's looking bleak, folks. at this rate, life getting better vs it getting worse is a coin toss.",

        "content": "still feel horrible after 2 months withdrawal hi,\n\ni was on zoloft for 4-5 years for anxiety (which i\u2019ve had my whole life) and depression that had gotten bad during that time. it really helped me. though, it really decreased my libido and made me numb, and was sleeping a lot. i didn\u2019t totally feel like myself. i tried tapering off it about 2 years ago but had immediate suicide ideation and was crying all day every day. so my therapist and psychiatrist put me back on it. i felt good again. \n\nabout a year ago, i told my psych about my negative side effects. she also put me on wellbutrin to weigh each other out. i liked it, but it wasn\u2019t the perfect fix. after about a year we decided to try and taper off of just the zoloft. i was only on a small dose of 25mg at the time (had been going down in dosage over the last couple of years when being on wellbutrin as well and trying to help my side effects of zoloft).\n\nit\u2019s been 2 months off the zoloft and i feel my depression symptoms are only getting worse. my therapist thinks i just haven\u2019t had to deal with emotions like this in a long time and i have to work on trying to handle them all over again. i do agree with her, but every day is a struggle. i cry most days, sometimes i\u2019m flooding myself and am laying in bed crying over nothing. i feel very depressed and irritable and unhappy about everything. i sleep a lot. i\u2019ve tried doing a lot of what i\u2019m working on in therapy but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to stop this depression. i\u2019m trying so hard to push through and wonder if it\u2019ll just adjust in time but i don\u2019t know\u2026 is this normal? does anyone have any advice? i\u2019m suffering and i just want to feel better.

        "content": "instant gratification robbed me of purpose ? i often compare myself from how i feel now, lazy, unmotivated, aimless, and a bit hedonictic to when i was a child, full of curiosity, wanting to explore the world, greater emotional resilience and calm and i couldn't put the finger on what changed. certainly, a lot of things did change, puberty being one of them but i feel like the way i see life lost it's colours. \n\nand i feel like i can trace back to when i received the wii console. i was 9 years old and after getting to play with it, it felt so much better and easier to access than most life pleasures. as an example of my taste for it, we had to do a poem in school for our moms, once i went back home i read mine to my mom and sometime after i politely asked if i could play the wii, she declined stating that i could do without today. i tore my poem in front of her saying that she didnt love me. \n\nduring my teenage years, i had depression also part to some life events, i used video games to self soothe, and i didn't feel like working was worth the reward. now i realize all  these years, whenever i felt like instant gratification was an option, hard and purposeful actions lost all appeal. why work so hard if i can get around it and still get a reward. now i feel angry at this technology world full of instant pleasures. i feel robbed of my deeper self, one that can manage life without being bribed by superficial pleasures.\n\ntldr : i just wanted to say that out of all my life hardships, none seems to have been as decisive and life-changing as much as instant gratification was. and the simple fact of learning delayed gratification would have made much of these hardships less painful",

i know it sounds stupid, everyone else does so why can't i? i genuinely feel like there is absolutely nothing for me, like i was some error somewhere that wasn't actually supposed to be here so now i'm stuck belonging somewhere i wasn't supposed to. just living life because i feel like i have to. i don't have a partner (still have to tell my folks i think i\u2019m lesbian woohoo), friends, the only connection i have is the occasional conversations online and the small talk at work that's insignificant, and my parents. i also believe my autism works against me when it comes to socializing and i swear everyone sees that. i haven't had a friend in years and that never really bothered me. i'm naturally a quiet person but my mom keeps mentioning it which really rubs my wound, thanks mom i know i'm lonely lols.\n\ni don't really have much going for me. i have an average job that makes me feel sore at night. i don't have many hobbies other than drawing but that's just a little activity that doesn't mean much. i don't have much i treasure either. like i guess i can say my parents obviously, i love my folks but even now the feeling is just so bland. i used to be very passionate about caring for my animals (i looove my pets) but again, it's just so bland, so annoying, my pets and family. i sound like an asshole but that's just how i feel and i hate thinking that. all i can ever think, every day coming home from work is \"when will this be over\". just about everyday i think to myself that i really want an off switch. everyday is annoying, exhausting, and meaningless. the closest thing i have to peace is when i sleep but even then i'm awarded a gracious 6-7 hours. i usually sleep in till late afternoon on my days off which is the best thing life has to offer right now.\n\ni didn't really want this to be a self pitying post, more like a view of how i see my life, (note i've been feeling this way since starting 15-ish?) but take it as you will.\n\nanyways, i guess the \"request personal support\" part is, how do i find value in time and just life in general? or advice on how to stop making life feel like a chore? can i even feel better after feeling this way for so long? i have to find some value in life, i mean i'm asking for help kind of so that has to mean that i do. has anyone else felt this way but found more fuel to go on? is it too late to find spark in life? how did you start adulting when you had no idea how to? how do you care for yourself as a new adult? if you're neurodivergent, how??? how do you live your life without being miserable? does therapy really help and how was/is your experience with getting medicated and therapy? how are you doing with your depression? i'd also love to read some things that made you keep going. hobbies, practices, pastimes, and such.",

        "content": "i'm at the edge of a cliff i always feel like i'm at an edge of a cliff, waiting for something that can completely push me off. i have a sickly mother who'd been abroad since i was 3 to get treatment and to work. for almost 2 decades we only met her every 4 years, i've only spent 1 christmas with her which was when i was already 18. i have a drug addict father who was never present in my life, he left us to be with another woman he impregnated when i was just 2, never took responsibility for my mom or me, or even just provide financial support. he never tried to reach out, all those few time we've met when i was young, it was my mom bringing me to visit him...then he got imprisoned and i never saw him since then.\n\nsince i was young my mom left me with her brother, my uncle, i was a little hard to deal with when i was a kid, if i heared adults cuss i learn it as well, i always got scolded because of it. after a few years, my mom decided to leave me with her older sister, she was nice to me but my cousins where mean and her husband also scolds me whenever i faught with his kids, how i wish i had a father who i can rely on to defend me as well. i didn't stay there for very long, i moved to another older sister of my mom whose sons where also mean, she have a blunt personality ang her sons always glares at me and never fails to remind me that they just took me in.\n\ngrowing up i never got along with my relatives, as a child i always felt wronged, they favored my younger sister, they always tell me i should just understand because she's younger, even though i was also just a kid back then. all the emotional and verbal abuse i got from them will forever be carved on my mind. at school i've been bullied by other people but i never told my family because i'm not comfortable telling them, all the bullying i got from other people cannot compare to all the mean words i got from my own family, i'm asian but i've been called the \"n\" word by them for being dark skinned. growing up my insecurities just kept adding up, and most of these insecurities was caused by my own family.\n\ni've never noticed i had an overbite until my aunt pointed out that my mouth looked like a hook, i never realized i had saggy boobs until my aunt pointed out that it looks worst than that of a breast feeding mother. others always tell me i should just be understanding because she also had traumas growing up with his abusive father.\n\ni never realized anything wrong with my skin until my family pointed out how my white clothes looked as if it was floating in the dark, my mother knows this, she even witnessed one of my cousin make fun of my color once, they were making fun of her height and comparing it to mine cause i was taller than her despite being younger, i stayed quite and she said \"at least i'm fair\" i wasn't the one who made fun of her for her height but she insulted me for my skin. my mom didn't even scold her. she knew all of the things i went through in the hand of the people she left me to, although she sympathize with me she never tried to take me out of that situation or never tried to confront my cousins. and every time, i am left with no choice but understand her situation because she has kidney problems.\n\nin our family, raising your voice even when you're just trying to defend yourself is disrespectful, you have no rights to defend yourself because to them, you're just talking back. in our family making fun and criticizing someone for their appearance is okay. growing up in a family with twisted moral values, everything that comes out of their mouth, about lecturing sounds like a joke. i grew up with little respect for them and can anyone blame me? you can't lecture me about attitude problems when what you like to do to pass time is to speak ill about other people.\n\ngrowing up i failed to develop any social skills, i wish i had a present, attentive, lovable parents, i envy my cousins having present parents, i envy my classmates who got picked up by his parents at school, they were very attentive and sweet to him, his father was nice to me and even pats my head everytime before they go home, i've always longed for a father's care like that, it was just unfortunate that my father doesn't love me. i envy other kids i see on the internet who haws parents that loves each other.\n\nsince i was young i found it hard reading social cues leading to me always embarrassing my self in public, and my aunt never fails to nag me and remind me of how humiliating my actions are. at 16 i was diagnosed with social phobia, i was afraid of people, i couldn't even talk to them. i feel like doing anything else is useless, i have no social skills, which is essential if i ever want to find a job or build relationships.\n\nevery time my relatives tries to remind me of how useless my father is, i always agree, although sometimes i curse at him to other people out of anger, deep down i was always hopeful that one day he'd knock outside of our doorsteps and try to make it up to us. my mother has 8 siblings, in my 19 year of life none of them tried to offer their kidneys, every her siblings tell us they love us, i find it hard to believe, i understand they have their own families to look after, but they shouldn't lie about loving us cause only a fool would believe. if they love us they wouldn't want us to grow without a parent. now, i can't even donate to my mom even if i want to because just when my life couldn't get worse, a year a ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to undergo radiation, because she had been a kidney patient for so long, her immune system deteriorated so she got cancer. now we have to wait until she's completely cancer free, that's about 5 years of waiting for us to find out if it comes back or not.\n\ni grew up having no proper guidance, my aunt was not very open to emotional conversations, so i grew up not comfortable to opening up to anyone. i waited for 18 years of my life for our family to reunite, to be fixed. i was willing to understand the past years that they weren't there, then my 18th birthday came, i didn't leave my room, then my sister brought a cake to my room and i didn't respond nor eat the cake, i stayed in my room, windows shut, lights off. the next day was my former best friend's birthday where she held a debut, i went, there i saw so many people, i've always admired her for being so social, nice, it's no wonder she have many friends, her parents that loves her, many people that loves her. it really made me realize how different we were.\n\ni'm almost 20 now, i dropped out of college in 2nd sem because i just couldn't do it anymore, it felt like a torture that never ends. my mom always told me she'll support me in any decision, after i told her that i'll just pursue my passion for art she said it was okay but i know it's not, i feel it, she doesn't support me like she does with my studies.\n\ni don't blame her though, i grew up to be a big ball of hopeless mess, i was only diagnosed with sad but that's only because we only consulted a psych once, but i think i'm dealing with more mental issues than that, we just never got it checked because my aunt always remind me of how expensive it is and i am always embarrassed, i don't want for people to see me as this person who have nothing else but her mental issues. so i get it if my mother feels like i'm a disappointment and a waste of her time, now that i'm already an adult, she no longer have responsibility over me.\n\nnow i'm just a mess, i regret being born, others values life so much but i just really don't see what's so good about it, i don't see any future for myself. if i can give my life to someone else i would.",

        "content": "i\u2019m beginning to hate myself to an intolerable level, and its making me spiral i(20f) have struggled with depression for all of my adolescence and there has never been a time in recent memory where i have fully recovered. i constantly relapse into anger, sadness, dissatisfaction, discontent, and this indescribable pain that i cannot shake. i\u2019ve gone through this for so long, i\u2019m getting the point where i physically cannot take it anymore.\n\nit\u2019s vain, i know, but it\u2019s mostly surrounding my looks, my position in society, and my overall womanhood. i don\u2019t want to go into graphic detail, but i first developed a complex around the age of 12 after i was sexually assaulted. that\u2019s where the mood swings, obsession with my appearance, and growing fear of men. if i\u2019m being entirely honest, it was probably nestled somewhere in my brain before than\u2014considering that i was already living a dysfunctional home and was also sexually abused by my doctor, a man who i deeply trusted and was my pediatrician my entire childhood. i didn\u2019t even realize he molested me until i was 17 years old, and that just made the depression worse.\n\ni\u2019ve always attracted older men, and it disgusts me. all men disgust me, really. despite this i have resigned myself to a fate of being shackled down to an older man, if i get married at all, because it doesn\u2019t make a difference to me. i\u2019ll never be satisfied in life regardless of what happens, so why even fuss about anything? i don\u2019t even want to get married, really, i just think i probably will because i always cave to societal pressure and i can\u2019t help, but fawn around men. i hate that i can\u2019t control it, but i either fawn or freeze in their presence because i don\u2019t know how to interact with them, hence why i avoid them as much as possible. \n\nand i know i\u2019m getting worse because i\u2019m usually repulsed by the idea of sex. i\u2019m always so grateful i\u2019m still a virgin given the times i narrowly escaped being raped, but when i spiral i become much more sexual and i hate that because it feels so barbaric. i try to stay inside as much as possible during these times, because i know i will become overly compliant and easy\u2026and the last thing i want to be is easy. \n\nanyway, i hate the way i look\u2014always have. i guess people find me attractive, i don\u2019t get it though. all i see are flaws, and i try so hard to be different but nothing works. i hate everything and everyone. i fly off the handle over little things and spiral into rages. nothing satisfies me, no matter what i achieve or who i\u2019m around. i constantly have intrusive thoughts of hurting myself or others. i literally looked up mental institutions in my area because i feel like i should hospitalize myself before i get worse, but i know i would never actually get myself help. i can\u2019t even hide it in pictures. i never smile and i always look upset or angry, even when i try to smile it shows. \n\ni feel like a monster no matter how hard i try, a disgusting pestilence. sometimes, i just want to release myself from the prison that is my body and be done with it all, but i don\u2019t want to disappoint my family. i wonder if it\u2019s genetic, because people in my family have struggled with depression, addiction, and suicide as well.

        "content": "life looks meaningless i will get straight to the point, in the past (2 years ago) i finished highschool and i had wierd tendencies, like having multiple girl friends && i was watching porn from 9th grade. so, talked to a lot of women and all of my attention during all of my relationship was sex in the short term. i got into 3 short term relationships, most of are haunting me to this day. i stopped all of that somehow, broke up with the third one. i had dreams of making money so i decided to learn marketing from guys like iman gadhzi, andrew tate...etc.\nbut after a year of learning and so on, i realized that my progression is really slow + english isn't my main language + i live in syria  so it's a bit hard to talk to americans since the media makes syrians terrorists. so, those are the sensible problems, but there are internal problems like i was litterally struggling to wake up early (which is basic thing), struggling to get rid of social media distrations ( i had it from a young age since i was getting annoyed from people that don't respond && checking my phone every moment esp when texting a girl ). so, basically social media and old childhood problems and girls (like no friends, racism  when i was in german ( cuz i am musilm ) were merged together to form a problem i call it \"always distracted by someone i talk to on social media evne though i may not be talking to that person in the moment\"  \npeople haunted me like they look at me all the time.\nthere is a third internal problem which was stupidity.\n\ni didn't realize those problems at all during highschool cuz life was pretty basic.\n\ni mentioned that i was a muslim and still practically, but since i was dating girls in a religious country && the fact, i have a lot of muslim friends that i printed the image of being a strict muslim in thier heads ( i really was into islam back then and loved it), make me feel like i am being haunted all the time, like i am doing something wrong.\n\nso, i got rid of the girls thing  as i said becuase it looked meaningless and because i had dreams to be successful. \n\nso, during the time i was learning marketing, i became a friend with an atheist that had the same interests as me but forced me to think the opposite side of islam.\n\nthis really distracted me from everything except philosophy which i was kind of interested in. \nso, started thinking in life in an extreme way for half a year.\n\ni just was thinking, watching podcasts, reading a bit, going to the gym, learning programming ( cuz my atheist friend and the sensible problems i stated above made me think in a different skill to learn + cs is my major), got somehow rid of all people talking to me in my head, all of my fears.\n\nthen, i reached a point, that i didn't know how to continue thinking philosophically while applying what i conclude, it got complicated so muchin my head, that i now sit the part for 12 hours doing nothing, i don't know what happens,  but what i was always trying to relate, my actions, speech, thoughts  to my  philosophical fundementals that i build half a year ago, but as i said it become hard to connect everything together because of braodness and complexity,  so i started feeling like i am just talking without knowing if what i am saying is true or false.\n\npeople take things simple, i feel \"am i the only one that is seeing something really big, horrible to come to judge us all??\" \n\nthere is no guidence, no motivation to continue, no friends, all of it is ditraction from the real stuff but even my brain isn't helping me to reach somewhere. \n\nmy question is, after everything i have done wrong in the past, i beleive i made myself somehow stupid, but now, after i got rid of everything wrong in my life my brain resists to think clearly and help me find continue the journey i began in finding the truth (because everything was and still mainly towards that goal)  and this is making me suicidal",

        "content": "is there anything i can do? hello, i'm not sure how to properly start this, and i know no one actually see's these but i still want to tell someone. recently, no actually not recently for a while now i've noticed my moods been lower. i look at myself in the past and notice i never had anything to be sad about or to feel down about. in fact i'm not even sure if its sadness i'm feeling but i know its not happiness like i used to feel. i can't get these things out of my head no matter how much i try. i go to school every day and act like nothings wrong but now i realize that i only hide my weakness behind confidence because im to scared to tell anyone. in life your parents and family should be the people you can come to for problems like this. but in my case for a problem involved with depression im not even sure my family would seriously listen to me. im in my senior year so i know i can just push through but tbh sometimes i get these deep dark thoughts, and i try to cover them up by telling myself its fine or something else that can ease my mind. im 18 and for 17 years of my life so far i've never touched myself in any shape or form. i wont get into too much detail but for the first time in   my life i did that dirty act. i feel dirty but for some reason i did it again despite that fact. to top all of that off i really don't feel like living my life is as worth it as i once thought. i had big dreams and i know i can accomplish them, but now i just feel lazy and just feel like taking an easy way out would be...well easier. even as i type this out i feel this way. i made a promise with a girl that if we didn't work out now i'd still put in the effort to come back later and sweep her off her feet. she got another bf in less than a month. i didn't know until then that people could lie to someone so easily like that. now to topple that onto school and responsibility everywhere else and you have this massive weight on your shoulders. now im just yapping so i guess i'll end this here. tbh if i don't ever come back to post on this you can probably assume i killed myself. if i post again i can't promise but it should be a positive status update. anyways till next time people of the internet.",

(partners & friends) & it\u2019s the same @ school, wake up, get ready, go to class, \ud83d\udd14, break, sit alone or w/ people, but they r just there, i\u2019m still alone, \ud83d\udd14, next class, sit there unable to bring myself to try anymore,\ud83d\udd14, & repeats, over & over & over, like a script, over & over, laughing, smiles, talking, screaming, noise x2, all so loud, so obnoxious, so annoying, so pathetic. & from watching & listening, i\u2019ve learnt that everyone is js hiding behind obnoxious behavior, trying to find meaning behind it all, they try to fit in bc it gives them a goal, they r loud bc they want to feel important, like they know what they r doing, they r arrogant bc they want to pretend like life loves them, & they r different, the ignorant js r coping so that they can believe anything they want, bc deep down they know that if they acknowledge it, everything that keeps them in their happy little world will crumble & then they realize how pointless & depressing it all is. the ppl that can\u2019t pretend drown themselves in substances, or they try & hide behind a mask finding anything wrong that they can fix, focusing on the negatives that r minor & r in reality controllable, everything is structured so that we r more worried abt anything but the fact that there is no point to it @ all, animals have the luck of a small brain. they can\u2019t think of anything outside of what they r supposed to do, they can\u2019t see the bigger picture, we\u2019ve forced others to suffer by making them rely on us, or by making them more aware, dogs didn\u2019t have to become these pets that w/out a human feel pain, now they need us to love them, to feed them, to protect them from the cruelty of the world, all so we can feel a sense of purpose or achievement. the human race is like icarus. we flew to close to the sun, &  now we have to deal w/ the consequences. we strive for a greater purpose in this world, strive to evolve more & more, now we\u2019re our own predator. our greatest enemy is ourselves. we alone cause our own suffering. we evolved too much. we were too self-aware. so we created structures, materialistic things, money the idea of love government, social norms, beauty standards, the idea of what makes us happy all that to distract from the greatest suffering of all, awareness, we\u2019ve run to religion, or some belief so that we don\u2019t question what the point of any of it is, what is it to be happy? what\u2019s the point of chasing this idea of happiness if in the end it\u2019s always taken away bc nothing is permanent except for suffering. it\u2019s always there waiting in the background. they always say there can\u2019t be happiness w/out sadness or anger or negative feelings, yet there can be suffering w/out happiness, but it would js be the norm or is it already the norm? perhaps by running from suffering we have only created more agony. if we all js accepted this suffering & the feeling of loneliness then we wouldn\u2019t feel so alone. everyone would understand that feeling & probably we\u2019d still try & find things that bring this idea of happiness to us, but the only difference is if we\u2019d accepted the suffering before & didn\u2019t try & run from it, didn\u2019t try to ignore it, to be blind to it, then maybe we\u2019d all feel js a little less alone or maybe we wouldn\u2019t, maybe that would js make the suffering greater for when we found happiness. we\u2019d need more bc there was no suffering. & then we\u2019d never feel fulfilled, an endless chase for more & more & more bc it will never be enough & then you enter the cycle again. it\u2019s never enough. it\u2019s never enough suffering, never enough happiness, never enough money, never enough. we can never be satisfied, humanity as a hole is js icarus. never satisfied, always reaching for more always needing more till we fly too close to sun. it\u2019s so depressing but i can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s more depressing that some ppl r so ignorant to this or if it\u2019s more depressing that some ppl r so aware of it. it\u2019s an endless trap in your own head. there\u2019s 1 side of me that wants to stay so i can help others who might feel like this, but idek how to help myself & it\u2019s so depressing. everyone keeps telling me that i\u2019m js aware & emotional intelligent (eq) & that it\u2019s a gift, yet all it causes is suffering & loneliness. it sounds like a flex or something an arrogant person would say, \u201coh no one is as emotionally intelligent as me @ my age haha\u201d but it\u2019s fkin not, it\u2019s a curse, especially w/ my family, as they don\u2019t have as high \u201ceq\u201d or at least not to my extant, according to my therapist, it\u2019s fkin hell. the 1s who r blessed r those who don\u2019t have a high \u201ceq\u201d. i envy them, i loath them all. they can get up & do things they like, i can\u2019t even force myself to get up & paint, or sing, or draw, all i can do is doom scroll, so i don\u2019t fall too deep into my thoughts @ least for a while. i wish i could \ud83d\udc80 or maybe i wish i wasn\u2019t so aware. @ least not @ my age. \nso now idk what to do, i feel guilty trying to \ud83d\udc80myself, specially w/ the ppl who r trying so hard to help me, but i js can\u2019t stand being here, having these thoughts constantly go through my head, i can never be happy. i never look forward to anything. idk what to do anymore. i\u2019m so tired, so exhausted. \n(\u26a0\ufe0fmention of sh \ud83d\udd2a and attempts\u26a0\ufe0f)\ni cut activity (i am trying to stop, i am getting help, you if do it too, pls also reach out for help), i\u2019ve attempted more than 3 times, i\u2019m jst barely keeping myself from falling into substance abuse, all of this, @ js 15. on top of that, i\u2019ve been trying to help o who\u2019s a narcissist & a druggie, who can\u2019t get help bc of her situation, which alone is so depressing. she\u2019s the only person @ my school i consider close to me in a way, besides j, but i still feel alone. the shit i have gone through this yr is so fked, i js can\u2019t take it anymore. idk what to do. please help. \n(also sorry for all the abbreviations, the post is already long so i wanted to shorten it as much as possible) ",

        "content": "seeking support i need to vent. i\u2019m 35 years old and have been struggling a lot since the pandemic. there have been some better and worse times, but i haven\u2019t been able to fully recover. i feel completely useless, as i\u2019ve been on medical leave since january 2024. i had been in therapy for years until october 2024, but it\u2019s been very challenging. the breaking point came when i had two different therapists from may to october, and in mid-november, i attempted suicide. since then, everything feels like an insurmountable obstacle.\n\nseeing myself in such a bad place and not being able to buy a home, my parents helped me purchase a studio apartment. i\u2019ve been working on the renovation for months, but every setback feels like the end of the world. there are many issues that need fixing because the contractor was careless, and i can\u2019t stop obsessing over the fact that nothing is perfect. i feel like my parents have spent so much money, i\u2019ve also invested a lot, and i have no energy to do anything\u2014whether it\u2019s cleaning or assembling furniture. i spend hours trying to get things done, but the result is never what i expect. everything feels so expensive, and i can\u2019t achieve what i envision. i obsess over things like the floor, which i didn\u2019t replace because i can\u2019t afford another $4,000 for changes after already spending $30,000 on the renovation. it\u2019s a 2003 apartment that we\u2019ve made a lot of changes to, but in my mind, it\u2019s never enough, and i constantly seek perfection.\n\nadditionally, dealing with different people for cleaning, renovations, and furniture assembly feels overwhelming. trusting people, choosing the right person, and spending so much money only for things not to turn out as expected makes me feel incapable. adulthood has become incredibly hard. a month ago, i saw a new psychiatrist, and i was diagnosed with adhd and anxiety-depression. i started medication with 10 mg of rubifen prolong because it made me anxious, but my doctor increased the dose to 20 mg, along with 60 mg of fluoxetine. i\u2019m planning to increase the dose soon to see if it helps. i\u2019ve also tried medications like latuda and abilify, but they haven\u2019t worked well and made me excessively hungry.\n\nto make matters worse, in the last six months, i\u2019ve gained 8 kg, which is really hard for me to accept. i already had some extra weight, but now i feel even worse. i gained weight after stopping ozempic because it didn\u2019t sit well with me. after such a long time without working, i feel like i need more time to heal, but at the same time, i feel useless. on top of everything, i still haven\u2019t been able to move into my apartment because there\u2019s so much left to do, and i can\u2019t seem to get through it. every task feels like a mountain i can\u2019t climb.",

        "content": "partner is going through existential crises for years, how can i support but also honor my needs? i have a long distance relationship with a man for a year. he is going through a tramatic time in his life. i dont want to go into details of his situation but generally speaking, there have been 4 existential crises he has been going through for the past 3 years and more than one will continue for another 2 years. this is the most difficult time in his life and it has caused him to fall into depression and have a hard time functioning with his adhd. he sees a therapist regularly and is on meds. he describes his situation as a cancer that is slowly killing him and he just has to watch it take his life. he seems to be doing pretty well considering what he has to deal with. i would not even be able to survive 1 of the crises he's dealing with. since his situation is going on for many years, it's taken a emotional and financial toll on him and he is really in despare. he really values and appreciates having me to talk to daily, giving him support, and words of affirmation. he likes receiving my texts and i bring some sunshine to his otherwise gloomy life at the moment. he is often not engaged or proactively thinking about what he can do for me because he is so consumed by his own issues. it's difficult for me to bring up issues i have in my day or tell him how i want him to show up in conversation when i know he is struggling so much in life. i feel my worries and issues pale in comparison to the issues he has to deal with.\n\nmy question is, *how can i best support him while also honoring my needs in the relationship?* \n\nfor example, he's not able to talk a long time about theoretical concepts when he's got things at hand that need his immediate attention. however, i have a need for my ideas and thoughts to be heard. i am fine with withdrawing from the relationship and putting it on pause for a few years until he deals with his issues and then revisiting our relationship once he's found more stability in his life. however, he would really like me to be part of his life as he is going through this because he wants my support during this difficult time. he doesnt have much supportive close friends. he says he values and appreicates me but i dont feel it as i would with a partner who is present. i also wonder what how he would act once these crises have been dealt with 2 or 3 years from now since i have only known him with these issues and not before them. \n\ni continue to date in my local area and he is fine with this as he doesnt feel jealous or controlling. for the past year i have been giving him a lot of attention and really thinking about his needs but i feel burnt out as my cup doesnt get filled by reciprocation. he says he's appreciative of everything i do. i always give without expectation of reciprocation but i just lose steam if i dont feel rejuvenated. he says he's been operating at the first two rungs of maslow's hierachy (basic needs) and i have been able to get him to the next rung (belonging and love needs) on occasion. \n\nwhat can i do?

        "content": "struggling lately this is going to be kinda a long post\n\ni\u2019m new to this group but not to depression. i\u2019ve had severe depressive episodes since i was 12. i\u2019m struggling a lot rn. at the beginning of this year, i quit my job to go to fire academy and it\u2019s been going so good. i really love it. it\u2019s been great for my mental health and i finally feel like i\u2019m doing okay in life. things were going so good that i forgot for a while how easily i can slip into a depressive episode. recently i got injured in school and now i can\u2019t do any of the hands on stuff in class and i\u2019m unable to help out at the fire department i volunteer at in my free time. now all i can do is sit around my house and go to class just to sit on the sidelines. and hope that my injury heals in time for me to finish my skills and graduate. im in pain due to my injury and i can\u2019t help but be angry. angry at my body for failing me, angry at my brain for letting me think i was okay. angry at life for teasing me with happiness and stability. it feels like i finally found my purpose in life just for it to be ripped out of my hands. and when i don\u2019t feel angry i feel completely numb. i stay up late on my phone scrolling social media and sleep in late just to lay in bed all morning on my phone. showering, eating, interacting with my partner, all feels exhausting.. and the last two days particularly have been almost too much. i have family and friends that i could call but they all have their own problems they\u2019re dealing with so i don\u2019t want to burden them with mine and my partner (whom i have been with for 8 years) has done so much for me dealing with my mental health that i don\u2019t want to put this on them. i guess i just don\u2019t know what to do. the depression feels all consuming at this point and i\u2019m starting to lose touch with my life and the world i guess. part of me knows that things will get better eventually as they always do but the other part of me just doesn\u2019t believe it and doesn\u2019t want to go through all of this again. \n\ni know all of you have your own struggles with life and mental health. but if anyone has any words of encouragement or quotes or music or advice that has gotten you through the hard times i\u2019d really appreciate it. thank you for reading",

        "content": "back to depression after breackup i gaslighted the woman of my dreams for our whole relationship\n\n\ndamn this gotta get off my chest. im in such pain.\nit's not as simple, or maybe it is, but it's gonna take quite a bit to explain it all.\n\n\ni went back to school at 26 and meeted a very beautiful woman i'll call d. d was french and in canada since short and as soon i saw her i wanted to get closer.. notice that she was the only one my age in the whole school. \n\nill tell more explanation as it goes but my first intention was to get laid. yup. im a dude.\n\n so she got a little bit friend with a guy i knew at that time. like she had a little gang of friend and he was one of them.\n\nso i got to him and asked nicely that i really wanted to get to know her and i asked him if he could invite me over the next time she'd be around. i was honest about just wanting to get laid. so he did. next time he was to see her ( he was already in love with someone else ) he invited me over so i came.\n\nthing worked i got there and played pool (there was pool in that school) and she was very nice to me. i remember i said i didn't want to eat mcdonalds and she said she didn't like it either. first common point.\n\nlater on as i saw her in school i finally invited her to play badminton. she said yes! you gotta understand that i was loyal to my intention on getting laid. but thinking back, i was way too happy about it for just casual sex ahead. i remember feeling overwhelmly happy in my bed waiting to see her.\n\nso we met and played a couple of times badminton. i will remember my whole life the eyes of desire we exchanged as we play. we wanted each other so bad. \n\ni remember she wanted to do something for my birthday. as i said i never celebrated my birthday since i was 18. she just could get over that so she invited me over. it was a while someone haven't been that nice to me.\n\nand as time flew i remember when we got our first sexy time. it was at her apartment. we made love a long time. but you know, love without passion. and like one or two sleepover i had in the past i kissed her. not in a passionate way, more in a sexy/doninance way. still, she asked me later why i did. because she said she feeled \"something else\"\n\n we use to see each other a lot and sleep together so long we only had a couple of hours to sleep. i remember a night where we didnt even sleep at all and got to school anyway. school was important for both of us.\n\nbut i kept saying it was all about the sexy times. she asked me not to sleep with another woman. which i didn't (i really didn't. i always have respected her at maximum). she was like \" i understand and respect you state of mind. but i want that to be based on something.\" and i was like \" well it is based on something. there is shure something connecting the both of us. this is how thoses types of relationships are\". and i meant it. really. i dont want to have casual sex with a stranger. i want to like her as well.\n\nbut further the less, we just spent a lot of time together. we went on hiking, badminton,  some bowling and cinema. you know, typical relationship stuff. but i never realised i loved her, probably because i had her. \n\nas we where both in school we had different projects. yeah,  bullshit. this is what i wanted to think. i said i was going in another city or another province to keep with my professional life when school would have been done. and as she clearly stated she was sad for that, she swallowed that pill and planed some big project toooooo. damn.... that hurts. after time i definitely know it could have worked out. we could have moved the same city, even if we'd finish school with 1 year interval.i know we just could have been in love enough to make it workout. but i wanted too fuck other women.\n\nits what i has saying. i was trying to be as honest and humble as possible. i did say i was scared never to get laid with other women. i did say i thought that was something i was not rady to give up for. but keep reading, it might somehow manage to make some sens.\n\ni was telling her this was normal attirance interaction, to live everyday with someone thinking you'd end it up in a couple years. i think i though thoses years would never happen. \n\nsometimes i cought hey crying. saying she was going to loose me. it did hurt me. but all i managed to do is to find words to tell her shit was normal.\n\nshe sometimes asked me explanations. like what is going on? and i just could talk. that i could find words. let me be clear. i was an asshole this wholetime, and a lot. but i was somehow good with her, i mean, directly. i did give her love. i just never assumed it.\n\nshe could have leave me but she loved me so she stayed.\n\nso time flew.\n\n\" i'm the kind of guy that can't remember nothing about nobody\"\n\ni was studying to become a paramedic. i was pretty talented. mostly a lot motivated. working in the hospital of the town doing ekgs and studying a lot to become a master of my passion. long story short, i was a diamond driller before that, and came back to school, for a better life. was working 12h shifts, 28 days in a row. and coming back to school was a redemption. then, i learned it was even worst. doubling the fact that i considered i may have been too talented for the job, and that it was worst, i decided to play quit or double and keep my carrer in nursing. at university. guess what, got accepted. so i leaved.\n\nthen, i faced a part of all that. but it took me a lot: when i was in nursing school and faving first patient experience, i realised the job sucks. it's just not what i wanted. i wanted a stable life. i wanted a reason to live. and i was working so hard to get that, thinking it would give me a purpose - to save lifes. but yeah, no. the day to day life of it just plain sucked. so i leaved.\n\ni tried being a paramedic, since i worked so hard on it, and that sucked a lot too. probably was dealing with too much demons. double the unmeasurable lack of decent working conditions. so guess what, i quitted that too. \"i'll get back to shcool i guess\".\n\n\nthat took 8 months. 8 months i left her like she was shit. i didnt even gave her a nice last day. i dont even remember our last day in that town.\n\ni was thinking about her. i was. i texted her a little bit here and there, but very little. way to little for a guy who is supposed to be in love. but then, it was quite too much, i straight up asked her, \"hey, what's going on with you? i'd like some news\" \n\nanyone who read this has the right to think i have been a real fucking child for this,but she said two things: she planned changing her car, and she had a man in her life. so guess what, i suddenly realised all my traumas. everything cleared up. i understood everything wrong with me. like, it hurted so much to learn it that in a second i faced it all.\n\nfaced that i am an asshole to hurt her. that fucking thing one\n\nbut i faced a lot about me too. i all suddenly realised a lot of what was going on in my head. hey, disclaimer, i dont blame anything else that my whole self for everything that happened but it deserved to be said still:\n\ni had only two girlfriends in my life. her, lets call her d, and a, before d, a lot of years before.\n\ni was in love with a like i never saw anyone be. i dont want to explain the a story, but lets just point that she left me really hard and i was so hurt of that that i even ended homeless.\n\nthen i regained myself and remade my life, but i never thrusted. not even a friend. couldn't love, couldn't let me be vulnerable again.\ni was destroyed.\n\nthen, d came in my life, and i just couldn't reopen my heart. i was froze in a state where i couldnt step. not that i loved a still, not at all, but that i had a relation with love that i just seems to be more intense than i have ever seen anyone be, that i couldnt just let me be again. but thinking back today, i realize its something i had no control on. i did love her. from the very bottom of my heart.\n\ni dont love because it fits, because i need it or because \"it's what i want\". i love with my soul. my whole soul.\n\ni knew i was in love, i just could assume it.\n\nshe had every reasons on earth to get another man in her life. a man that love her, and show her.\n\ni called her. told her most of that. what i really wanted to tell her is that i was sorry to have broken her heart. i will never pardon me for that. and, second, that i love her. i never told her. i had to. it must have been a very wack call for her to get. but she told me she was so hurt from how i treated her that she don't even feel from my call. i totally get that.\n\nso my problem was to be in love. i was in love. and i didn't listen my heart. i was a poison to her.\n\nso today, i dont want to get back to paramedic position. i dont want nothing i dont care.\n\ni dont want to get over it. i love her unconditionally.\n\nhey, so you think i might just accept the fate and go on? what. you think i am now cured? fuck no. what will happen if i get a date? i'll \"just want to get laid, not in love\"..........again\n\n\n\nif you read it all. please, for my soul, leave a comment. bash me, hate me, compassionate with me i dont care. i really need to go all through this. i have no taste for life rn. i work, then i get in a parking lot doing nothing but listen to $uicideboy$ and wish i was dead\n\n\n\n\n\n",

blamed me. made fun of me. then he walked away, like i meant nothing. i begged him to stay. told him i was scared. i begged. he left anyway. the guy i thought i knew doesn\u2019t exist. he\u2019s a narcissistic, heartless monster. cold. calculating.\n\nafter i tried to kill myself, he texted my mom. she thought it was just an overdose- since i\u2019m allergic to meds- but he made sure to tell her the full truth. he knew exactly what he was doing. he knew how insane my mom is, how it would ruin my life, how it would make everything even worse for me. and guess what? it did. he set fire to the wreckage and walked away like it was nothing.\n\nand the funniest part? we were never even together. hah! he refused to put a label on it. said he didn\u2019t want to be \u201ctied down,\u201d but we acted like a couple in every possible way. and i fucking accepted it. like a fool. even after he cheated, i stayed. and he made sure to remind me over and over that if he really wanted to, he could talk to other women, that i had no right to say anything, because he wasn\u2019t my boyfriend. i had to shut the fuck up and take it.\n\ni could sit here and list every single thing he did to me, but what\u2019s the point? it\u2019d be longer than a fucking book. the emotional torture, the gaslighting, the way he would rip me apart and then pretend he had no idea why i was upset. but somehow, after everything, we \u201cclosed things off\u201d a couple of months ago. i was dying. i could physically feel my heart breaking, and it lasted for weeks. i was sick over it. barely breathing. and then, just when i was almost beginning to survive, he hits me with something new.\n\nhe tells me he\u2019s been going out with his neighbor. the one girl he always told me not to worry about. but oh, don\u2019t get it wrong- they were \u201cjust friends.\u201d and normally, i wouldn\u2019t even give a fuck- we were done, right? except this guy never went out with his friends. ever. so why now? and why the fuck would he tell me, knowing damn well how much it would fuck with my head?\n\nso i did the only thing i could do- i downloaded tinder. i needed a new favorite person. i needed a distraction, a replacement, something. because if i didn\u2019t, i honestly don\u2019t know what i would\u2019ve done. eventually, i met someone new. someone actually near me. someone who wasn\u2019t a complete fucking waste of time. and we hit it off. but i\u2019ll be real- i fucked up. i was still thinking about that piece of shit \u201cex,\u201d still carrying the weight of all the bullshit he put me through, and i started leading this new guy on. i liked him, genuinely, but i wasn\u2019t in it for the right reasons. i just wanted to put myself first for once, no matter how fucked up it was. and honestly? i didn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nand it was working. for the first time, i wasn\u2019t obsessing over my ex. looking back, i don\u2019t even think it was love. just raw, sick addiction. some twisted survival instinct. and just when i was finally over it, when i had flushed him out of my system like a bad drug, the motherfucker texted me. out of the blue.\n\nsaid he got some confession of love from someone, thought it was me. it wasn\u2019t. i told him that. should\u2019ve been the end of it. but no, this piece of shit suddenly wanted to talk. asking how i was. pretending to care. acting like he hadn\u2019t spent months treating me like absolute garbage. and then i hit him with it- told him i was also seeing someone. and that\u2019s when the real shitshow started.\n\nhe fucking lost it.\n\ni mean full, batshit meltdown. suddenly, the same guy who told me to shut the fuck up, who acted like i was nothing, started spamming my phone like a desperate little bitch. every fucking day. begging. pleading. saying he knew he fucked up. (meanwhile, reminder, he was still going out with that other girl.) telling me how she\u2019d never be me. how he wanted me. how i was everything.\n\nand you know what? i fucking played into it. not because i wanted him back. i wasn\u2019t obsessed anymore. it wasn\u2019t that. it was just fun. watching him be the pathetic one for once. watching him spiral, just like i had. i don\u2019t even know what that says about me. but i kept it going. because why the fuck not?\n\nthis bullshit has been dragging on for a month now. at first, he played the sweet, enlightened little philosopher. said he was grateful to me. that because of me, he finally realized he\u2019s human. that he has feelings. (oh, you mean the exact fucking thing i spent a year drilling into his dead, hollow skull? the same shit i wrote in all those letters i poured my soul into? but okay, suddenly now it clicks- how fucking convenient.)\n\nand then he dropped the bomb. said he thinks he\u2019ll be able to love and treat this other girl the right way- because of me.\n\nand i fucking snapped. are you kidding me? i spent over a year being ripped apart, being lied to, humiliated, abandoned, manipulated, gaslit into insanity- for what? so he could use me as his personal test run? so he could experiment on me, figure out how to be a decent human being, and then take all that progress and hand it to the next bitch on a silver fucking platter? fuck no.\n\nso i shut down. i ignored him. and when i did answer, i made sure it was as cold, as detached, as distant as he used to be with me. i made him feel what it was like. and just like i thought, the second he felt me slipping away, he panicked.\n\nand then the real him came out. he started calling me a bitch. a whore for fucking this new guy. and let me make one thing very fucking clear- he knew my trauma. he knew i was called a whore when i was a child. he knew i was sexually abused. he knew that word shattered me. and he still fucking used it. because that\u2019s what he does. that\u2019s who he is. a parasite that feeds off pain. a soulless, sadistic cockroach who thrives on control.\n\nand then- then- he had the audacity to act like he was better than me. because he \u201chadn\u2019t fucked her yet.\u201d like that somehow made him superior. like he wasn\u2019t a cheating, manipulative, backstabbing piece of shit. like i was the disgusting one. like i was the one who should feel ashamed.\n\nand now? now he says he\u2019s done. that i\u2019m the bad guy. that i\u2019m the toxic one. after everything. after he made me sent me screenshots of his group chat- where he and his little pack of degenerate, brain-rotted friends compared me to his new girl like i was some kind of fucking used car. pros and cons. side-by-side fucking analysis. where they laughed about how she\u2019s prettier. more sane. not useless. and he made sure i saw it all. every word. every fucking jab. just to twist the knife one last time.\n\nand now he says he\u2019s going to therapy. because of course he is. because the villain always finds a way to rewrite the story- make themselves the victim, make it seem like they\u2019re healing, like they\u2019re growing, while the person they fucking destroyed gets labeled as bitter, crazy, vengeful.\n\nand i swear- i swear on everything i have- i cannot accept this fucking bullshit.\n\ni have proof that he cheated on her. screenshots. solid, undeniable evidence. i could burn his perfect little redemption arc to the fucking ground. but here\u2019s the catch- he knows my boyfriend\u2019s user as well. and if i go scorched earth, he can turn right around and fuck up my relationship too.\n\nso tell me, what the fuck do i do? because sitting here and letting this piece of shit skip off into the sunset, pretending he\u2019s a changed man while i\u2019m left picking up my own shattered fucking remains- that\u2019s not happening. not after everything.\n\nso yeah, maybe this is unhinged. maybe this is unethical. but i don\u2019t give a single, solitary fuck. i need a mind as fucked up as mine. someone who gets it. someone who knows that people like this don\u2019t get to win.\n\nsomebody tell me how to make this motherfucker pay.",

        "content": "i wrote my suicide note march 13, 2025 \nam i just supposed to live this life and pretend everything is alright. does my loved one\u2019s want me to live in pain just so they can have the peace of mind that i\u2019m still alive. yesterday i saw my life flash before my eyes. after i ran out of tears to cry i was hit with this wave of nostalgia, i remembered every happy moment i had so vividly. they say that happens before you die, i feel like a part of me died. i want to die with my grandparents. i know they are old and i don\u2019t want to hurt them so badly. my parents are younger and stronger, i know they can handle it better. i am in a clear headspace when i type this and even now i feel like i want to be dead. i just need to reassure my parents that this is what i wanted and what is best for me. i can\u2019t wait to be dead and to be at eternal peace. what can i say to make you feel better, to make you understand that it was never your fault and it\u2019s the best choice for me. i tried therapy, pills, everything. i tried to let go, to fight it off, to pretend i\u2019m fine. these thoughts won\u2019t leave me alone. if you truly love me, you will let me go. if you love me, you would know how much i suffered and how badly i want it to end. i am not scared of death, i am scared of being alive with my thoughts. i will make sure i go out quickly and painlessly and in my last moments i will think of you. i have no regrets, only happy memories.

        "content": "i have autism and i hate how i will never be able to truly engage with regular people. about a year ago i got diagnosed with autism. i thought it might help me answer some of the questions i have about myself. like why i find it so hard to connect with the regular, average, 'normal' person. i hoped being able to be open about my condition might make people undergrad why i am the way i am but it just seems to make people think i'm a weirdo. i always feel paranoid, i always struggle to regulate deep down feelings of despair and now knowing that i'm not normal and that i can never be normal just fills me with a lot of self loathing. i tried so hard over the last couple of years to not let me bad thoughts take over me and try to be positive to everyone i meet but i just feel like no one really wants anything to do with me.\n\n\ni recently moved abroad as i'm a teacher and teaching in the uk was breaking me, the pay is good and the workload is certainly a lot less so that's been a positive, but being away from family has been tough and coming over as a single person has been quite lonely sometimes. it's come to a bit of a head today because people at work who i thought were friends (not super close, but you know, cordial enough that i thought we get on) all organised to go out together to watch the rugby on the weekend. now they all know i like rugby, i used to play rugby, but no one asked me if i wanted to come and just hang out as well. \n\n\nit's not the first time it's happened to, one person from my work came onto our bus (we have a bus which runs staff back to their accommodation) and literally asked every person invidually except me if they wanted to come out for drinks later. it just made me feel pathetic. \n\n\npeople just always interrupt me when i'm speaking and seem to never want to actually talk. no one wants to hear what i have to say in a conversation and seems like i'm an irritation to them. it puts me in such a horrible state of questioning myself of what i'm doing wrong. i try to 'mask' my more autistic tendencies throughout the day and i just feel exhausted and depressed afterward. all i wanted was to be able to interact with people and i don't know what i do that makes me such an undesirable person to be around. \n\n\ni have friends back in europe (i moved to oman) that i game with sometimes, however there's been some issues there as well that would just clog up an already long post so i wont go into it now. however the time difference can make that tricky to organise times to hang out so i just feel more and more isolated.",

        "content": "the phantom pressure is so stifling i can't believe i'm doing this lol, venting to a bunch of strangers on the internet, but i'm at a point where thinking of the present, let alone the future, is beyond stifling for me. i really wonder how people do it.\u00a0\n\nsome background, i suppose. i'm currently on medical leave from my university. an externally-affiliated psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression and sent me back home so that i can seek help from a local therapist and psychiatrist. throughout this entire process, my dad strongly believes that i'm not a depressed or \"mentally sick\" person, but i just lacked conviction.  \n  \nhe sat me down and said, \"so, what're your goals?\" hesitantly, i told him i want to return to university next semester. he nods, then tells me that if that's truly my goal, the pace at which i'm going is snail-pace slow. (i don't disagree. i've been struggling to do pretty much anything. eating, drinking, sleeping well, let alone do all the stuff like apply for jobs and revise for classes before the medical leave ends.) he continues, saying that if this is truly my goal, i have to work a lot harder so i won't be left behind and struggle with all the workload and pressure of studying abroad.\u00a0\n\ni know this is to be true. i felt it during my first year before i broke down mentally from all the external pressures that surrounded the entire experience. the break-neck pace with which people went with their studies and networking was so fast i felt like the world was a blur to me. at the time, it's almost like i can blink and everyone was moving on to the next event, the next item on their to-do list. within the first two months i felt burned out. it didn't help that within that brutal hellscape, most interactions felt superficial since i could just *feel* in my heart how people are secretly making a mental note of whether someone is worth being friends with based on one's ability and ambition. it's scary how, just at the mere thought of this, i can feel the phantom pressure weighing down on me.\n\n*if that's the case, then why don't i just not go to such a competitive university? i could've just told my dad that my goal is not to go back.*\u00a0\n\ni wish. even if no one around me says it, i can tell that they'll be disappointed in me. *what a shame for someone like you to give up on going to a good university. i guess you were too weak, unable to handle the pressure.* stubbornly, i also wish for my own sake i'm able to see this through so i won't ever regret it in the future. a future in which i won't get a job because i wasn't competitive enough.\n\nwith that context in mind, i listened on as my dad told me his suggestions on what i should do in order to enrich myself in preparation for the next lesson. as he went on, i realized that i wasn't looking at him, i was looking at the ground, and my back slouched forward as though it was carrying a ton of bricks.\u00a0\n\nwhen i came to, my dad was telling me how i need to be able to adapt. i need to be able to make the comeback from my current state. as tired as i feel, it's the world, cruel and brutal as it is. and i'm barely having a taste of how excruciating it is to live. i know he didn't bother to mince his words because, as he stated prior to this conversation, he wanted me to have a full taste of the real world. the entire conversation ended with a \"think on it, ultideduction,\" and i'm left processing what he just told me.\u00a0\n\ni know what he's telling me is the truth. i know that, but i feel nothing but dread at everything in the future. everyone around me are like maniacs, chugging down coffee religiously but out there becoming club presidents, organizing events for the student committee, doing all kinds of internships (some said to me in private they did 3-4 internships before going into university.) i can't help but think i'm beside a bunch of demihumans with how they're able to manage socializing, studies, clubs, etc. i don't know how many times i thought to myself, i wish i can be stronger and withstand the pressure, but here i am depressed and unable to get out of this bed. gosh, i wish i can just get out from this pit, so i am no one's burden. so i'm able to stand proudly beside my peers and not have the urge to shirk away every time someone asks me how i'm doing.\u00a0\n\ni wish. i wish. then despair/apathy swallows me whole.",

        "content": "how i fought my depression when i was struggling with depression, i often asked myself: what determines whether we feel happy or unhappy in life? the answer, i realized, lies in expectations.\n\nhappiness is the result minus expectation. if reality turns out better than expected, we feel happy. if it turns out worse, we feel unhappy. this means happiness is not just about objective circumstances but also about our inner expectations.\n\nit\u2019s not only about what you get in life but also what you expected to get. this understanding helped me a lot. i started to realize that i had some control over my expectations, and therefore, i had a tool to influence my own happiness\u2014independent of external outcomes. i also began to shift my focus toward the positives instead of constantly worrying about what i lacked. in a way, happiness is in our own hands.\n\nof course, lowering expectations isn\u2019t easy, as they often work subconsciously. but just being aware of this process already helps. if you realize your expectations might be too high, they naturally adjust. that\u2019s progress.\n\nthe key? don\u2019t cling to outcomes. aim high, but don\u2019t expect it. give your best, but don\u2019t assume the best result. if things go well, great! if not, don\u2019t let it drag you down. ironically, this even applies to happiness itself.\n\nthis mindset didn\u2019t cure my depression overnight, but it gave me back control. maybe it can help you too.\n\n(i feel obligated to say that i used chat gpt to improve fluency) :)\n\n",

(some studies even linked social anxiety and dopaminergic transmission abnormality in the brain, which i find very interesting.) i would like to know if you have had any experience with such medications and whether they have helped you. thanks.\n\n",

        "content": "looking for some advice hopefully? (trigger warning) sensitive topics. \n\n\nhi, so i\u2019ve dealt with anxiety/ depression on and off (anxiety constantly, depression sometimes, i\u2019ve been diagnosed with ocd recently (last couple years) /anxiety and the depression that comes with it) since i was around 14-15. i just turned 26 f. \n\n\nlately in the last couple weeks.. i feel like i\u2019m in an awful rut. i don\u2019t even know where it came from.. my medication was all over, my doctor put me on 120mg (cymbalta). i only took it for a couple days. it made me feel super out of it. so now i\u2019m back down to 90 mg. i\u2019ve just been feeling down/ bad thoughts, my ocd stuff and then \u2018nothing matters\u2019, \u2018everything is pointless\u2019 \u2018waiting for happiness\u2019 \u2018nothing will help me\u2019. \n\ni\u2019ve tried 3 medications now (zoloft only for 3 weeks), lexapro for around 5 months and now cymbalta for around 3? and i get into really negative loops of thinking and just \u2018it\u2019ll never get better\u2019 \u2018i\u2019m a lost cause\u2019 \u2018i\u2019ll always suffer\u2019, or that i\u2019m broken/unfixable. my anxiety has been back as well a bit. in my chest. like anguish almost. grieving over my grandpa has been incredibly hard as well. i lost him at christmas. i watched him die and it was one of the worst things i\u2019ve dealt with in my adult life so far. i also work in palliative care so i know that does not help my mental health at all, and i\u2019m overworked. so i\u2019m burnt out and constantly struggling to not be tired/overwhelmed/irritable. i\u2019ve been feeling general apathy and just not enjoying a lot of things and isolating myself. i just hate mental health issues. i hate feeling like i want to give up. and i\u2019m sorry for rambling as well or if this doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. i\u2019m not the type of person to ever talk about my problems or especially post online to strangers, but i just feel lost right now. it makes me feel broken. i was never like this until i took zoloft. ( i know so many people that zoloft has saved their livelihood and gave them their life back, i was just unlucky with it, i in no way want to bad mouth medication or scare people), but it ruined my mental health. my dad leaving, my ex and i breaking up and me quitting weed cold turkey, work mental breakdown / stress overload and zoloft sent me into a s. depression that\u2019s lasted an entire year now (i\u2019m not going to hurt myself nor am i in danger). within days my mind was racing and i couldn\u2019t be alone on zoloft. it was the worst experience of my life. i wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. it was all at the same timeline-couple months. it broke me. and now i don\u2019t know how to get back or if it\u2019s even possible. i want to think it is? i hope it is. if you made it this far thank you so much for listening. i want to be a positive beacon for other people and give them hope as well. i will say cymbalta has helped me so much, i just don\u2019t know if it suddenly stopped working or if i\u2019m just in a rut. any tips, reassurance or advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\ntldr; in a bad rut, please provide some hopeful words or advice? i read the rules and i saw that general reassurance isn\u2019t allowed? but maybe some advice or what helped you get through hard times etc. thank you so much!",

        "content": "i\u2019m at a loss with a friend one of my friends and i have been hanging out nearly constantly for the last three months; the whole friendship has been very vulnerable and transparent. we have had tons of sleepovers, mini adventures when the weather is good (it\u2019s been a cold winter here), and lots of deep talks. we\u2019ve talked a lot about our various mental health issues; we both have severe depression. he said that he has a tendency to self isolate intensely. \n\ncut to the end of february, he starts isolating. not as much talking, no interest in hanging out, sleeping in until noon or even later at times, then napping in the day as well, and only responding to me once a day\u2014 usually to things i said the prior afternoon. which makes communication pretty much impossible. i feel for him, i ruined so many friendships due to self isolation in the past, so i get that our brains kinda lock us in a cage. he has stated that he feels unpleasant and selfish to be around when he\u2019s in this mindset. \n\nbut at the rate things are going i feel like he has just put a hiatus on our entire friendship and it really hurts my feelings. i feel bad and kinda selfish for even feeling how i do currently. but at the same time i feel like him giving into these depressive habits so hard is also selfish in a way. it makes my brain hurt. i simultaneously have a lot of empathy for him but also feel spurned and i really don\u2019t know what to do or how to communicate anything. or even if i should communicate anything at all. \n\nanyone have any input or experience with this? i really miss my friend.

        "content": "i think i'm emotionally numb. i'm not seeking attention. i just wish to understand. i've been dealing with this ever since i left my mom's house to live with a friend because i got a job that was in town. that was 3 years ago.\nand at first i thought i was depressed and eventually i just became depressed, and i got out of that and started to feel happy again but now it's worse. i don't find joy in talking to people, i'm awkward and genuinely don't care. it's as if i have become a mindless robot living day by day. and i can find the use in things that i do which is why i do them it's just i can't find the joy in them. i try and think positive but its hard. i think my mind is programmed to think blankly or just negatively. i watched this youtube video about it and the girl said it's most likely because of a narcissistic parents. but i'm not really sure. i genuinely don't know if my mom is a narcissist. \n\ni made a post i think a day ago stating that i can't feel affection and that i needed help to try and fix it. \nsomeone had replied and asked if it's only with woman or with my family too. that question hit deep because it's like it was a breakthrough because after i had read it i literally asked myself, do i even love my family? i don't. i don't know how i haven't figured that out yet. but now i know. everytime i say i love you it just doesn't do anything to me. i don't mean it im literally just saying it back out of either kindness or just pure instinct. \n\ni'm 18 years old. not really sure as to why i'm feeling this way, well in better words i'm not really sure why i can't feel, but i'd love some insight on this.\n\ni can experience anger, fear but i'm not so sure on anxiety. i've never really understood anxiety anytime my friends were saying that they were having it. when they described it to me i couldn't understand why they were feeling like that. \n\ni think i can feel sadness. i mean i feel bad for all the woman i've hurt so to my lack of affection. i have to tell them that i don't like them when it would be the total opposite for them and it would hurt them. \n\nand i feel like i'm a horrible person. but i've really made a breakthrough with all of this because i was genuinely convinced that i just couldn't feel affection and i called it a curse. but now i am really experiencing the emptiness. i cant grasp any sort of positive emotions. \ni mean there are times where people would consider me to be happy, but i think i'm just forcing it. either that or i still have my emotions there just limited. that would make more sense because though i have a hard time communicating i can still feel a little grasp of joy at times. \n\nbut only when it comes to music i believe. i connect with people more when talking about music. and that makes me happy. \n\ni told my mom about it, i wanted her to get me a therapist to see what's wrong. she said she'll look into it. \ni don't give my mother enough credit for taking care of me as i should. she's been there for me for ever. and she works way too hard for me not too. the last time i cried was about a month ago, i also find myself to not be able to cry when i genuinely should. i'd like to cry, i think it'll help i think. anyway the last time i cried was when i was thinking back to when i was juivinilally angry at my mom and i layed on the floor (it's good for my back, i'm not poor i have a bed) crying but wasnt really crying. i tried to force it because in my mind i was thinking, \"your not crying enough that means you don't appreciate her\" and that made me sad. but it was only tears that came out, i wasn't really balling my eyes out like i should have, because i've done my mom very wrong. i ignored her for 1 month and a half. like zero communication, i refused to talk to her at all even when she wanted to talk to me. and we lived together as well at the time. and she forgave me. she has always forgave me for anything. and i like that but i dont feel anything when i'm around her. just a awkward silence as the music plays in the car.\n\n\ni'm sorry this post is really long, like i said i just really need some help. i want my feelings back. i want to be able to feel love again and joy and complete happiness. i wouldn't wish this on anyone. \n\nhelp me please.",

        "content": "stuck in a loop i've heard that being as descriptive and well thought out with this is the best way to go, so here goes. my name's gidget. i'm 25 years old, and have been cycling for the past few years with major marijuana induced depression, on top of my already pre-existing depression that i've seemingly had all my life\n\ni attended a private art college from '19-'23 for game design. just attending this college was a big thing for me, and i remember not only crying when i got into the school but also when i was accepted into my major a year later (not a guarantee). fast forward a bit to '22 when i met my then boyfriend of \\~ a year. i... i let him do the dumbest decision of my life and let him give me marijuana. i have regretted that day every day since, it feels like.\n\nwhat happened next seems like a blur. my depression seemed to spike - how could it not? after 22 years of my life sober, i finally had some of that 'happiness' everybody was talking about. i could see clearly, and knew that i could finally have days where i didn't hate myself or not want to get out of bed, but then it got worse. when i wasn't high, i didn't see the point anymore. so i got high again. and again. and again. eventually, after about 3 months, i dropped out of college, about 3 months before graduation.\n\nnow, there was a lot more going on than just marijuana : my two best friends in my major also dropped / switched schools, and my then boyfriend was giving me encouragement under the knowledge that i would most likely move to his state after graduating. i also want to remind you that i went to an arts college, and in my mind, and i'm sure to yours, understand that an arts degree doesn't really \\*mean\\* anything. if you want a job as an artist, you just need to be a good artist. the people hiring you care about what your art looks like, not about your gpa.\n\nand then i learned that i wasn't going to graduate. apparently (thank you stupid fucking advisor for not telling me until my last semester) i was missing \\~3 classes that i would have to make up the following year. and... it just seemed so pointless then. 4 years of my life spent toiling towards a degree that i no longer cared about, blocked by menial art history classes.\n\nso i dropped out. didn't really see the point in finishing out my year when i was already depressed, not with my boyfriend, and just wanted to get high. \\*sigh\\* what a stupid fucking decision.,,,\n\nfast forward 3-4 months, and he broke up with me. said he loved me, but wasn't \\*in\\* love with me. i could see it for what it was though. he was depressed himself and thought i could help him. long story short, two depressed people don't work well together. sooo, i moved back home with my family. and kept getting high. at this point in time, i've been high for nearly a year. straight. there was barely a day that went by that i wasn't huffing my pen to forget about everything that happened, just so i could hop on my pc and play games. so much for being a game \\*designer\\*, huh?\n\nanyway, last year, a new art friend helped me get a job at a dental company doing 3d printing. it wasn't far off from what i wanted to being doing, so i figured i'd stay and try to work up to digital design work, cad type stuff. my game design career was focused around 3d modeling, sculpting, etc so it was a good fit. i moved around from 3d resin printing to 3d metal printing - neat stuff - and then eventually, the company gave me a new job in 3d design! i was elated - still high, but elated. until they fired me. because it wasn't a 3d design position. they had lied to me to get me to do hand finishing using a lathe. so they let me go because i wouldn't do it.\n\nexcept i had just moved out of my mother's house a month prior. they let me go after i signed a brand spankin new $1200 aptm lease with my art friend. i still barely have 5 grand in my checking account.\n\ni was let go the first week of january. it's now march, and for the past few months, i've still just been getting high and playing games. sure i've sent out a couple job apps, but to no avail.\n\nand here i am, typing this out. there is one bright side - i stopped smoking about a week ago. that's right, a full week sober. i'm actually pretty proud i haven't even looked in that damn bag of weed.\n\nexcept... i feel worse than ever. i mean, logically i should. i get that. but staring at my art, at all the programs on my screen, i still just hop on marvel rivals and waste my day away. i mean, heck, my roommate gave me his old screened drawing tablet so i could do some zbrush work, and i've spent maybe 6 hours total working in it? and i know - i know - that i should be proud of myself for that. that i should celebrate that i can even open the program.\n\nbut i feel dead inside.\n\ni have always flitted between hobbies in prior years, but i really wanted to make 3d art stick, but every time i look at what i make, i just hate myself that little bit more. i don't even know why. objectively, i know that what i make is decent. not the best, not the worst. but i hate it. probably more so hate myself.\n\nthat's what's been going through my head for the past month every 3 seconds. \"i hate myself\" pervasively. interwoven into my very being is a hatred that i can't shake. and i don't want it. i know that. i know how badly i want to love the world and to cultivate a community that i love full of friends that care about each other, and i can't stop myself from hating myself.\n\nlast week, i spent an entire day laying on the floor. hours passed, hating myself.\n\ni'm not really sure if this is meant to be a positive post or not... i know i'm going to be doing better, eventually, because i could never bring myself to end it, no matter how wonderful that sounds at times. i can't make my mother go through that again, 30 years later.\n\nbut i needed to write this. to... i dunno, be held accountable for my actions? to be told i was right - that my decisions were awful?\n\ni don't really know how to end this kinda thing.\n\ni guess if you made it this far, you might be wanting to help, and i guess giving something concrete to help with might be more helpful for me in the long run so here goes.\n\nas an artist, you might think i've posted stuff on social media, but i don't. i can't. i don't know why, but i have such extreme anxiety and self loathing when it comes to posting things online. heck, even this is making my heart race some - maybe because i put myself out there for judgement? who knows. anyway, any advice on posting in this weird wild world could be helpful, i guess. and i don't mean 'how do i post', but like... how do i keep posting? how do i not care about engagement, or maybe how do i care about engagement in the right way? i'm not sure if that makes any sense...\n\nthanks for reading. much love. have a nice day <3",

        "content": "stimulants might be treating my depression\u2014but at what cost? context:   \n  \nsymptoms:   \nthe fact that my symptoms align with depression rather than adhd makes it difficult to perform a cost-benefit analysis of my long-term use of stimulant medication. based on the feedback i received from completing a comprehensive iq test administered by a psychologist at age 9, my \"working memory index\" (the only subset of intelligence negatively affected by adhd) was surprisingly my strongest cognitive dimension, falling somewhere in the 140 range. however, even though i obtained a vyvanse prescription by \"faking\" adhd-related symptoms, the medication completely reversed my life trajectory and changed my fortunes. this is a testament to the powerful anti-depressant effects of stimulant medication, particularly amphetamines\u2014although, i cannot comment on their potential to worsen anxiety because i have only experienced depressive symptoms in isolation. regardless, had i presented my true symptoms that emerged during adolescence and interfered with my completion of high school\u2014low energy/mood, psychomotor retardation (extreme sedentariness), and debilitating daytime sleepiness\u2014i venture to guess that my doctor would have prescribed a typical ssri as the first line of defense, and that i wouldn't have achieved such a remarkable career transformation (high school dropout at 20**\u2192**earning nearly six-figures at 22) in such a short period.\n\nvyvanse use:   \nstarted vyvanse two years ago at age 20, titrating to the max daily recommended dosage (70mg/day) within a few months. soon switched to split dosing: 40mg in morning, 30mg 6-8 hours later. rarely, if ever, exceeded 70mg in a single day up until 3 months ago. encouraged by my results, i optimized further with standing desk, nicotine patches, caffeine, creatine, cold showers twice daily, morning outdoor jogs daily, and regular non-sleep-deep-rest sessions.\n\nroutine & diet:  \ndiet: pescatarian-keto; single high-protein morning meal (alternating between fish, eggs, pea protein), occasional nuts/avocado snack, veggies with mct oil in the evening. protein intake rarely exceeds 50g/day.\n\nactivity: \\~2 hours treadmill walking daily while watching netflix/sports\n\nsleep: 5-6 hours/night.\n\nstats: male, 6ft, 125lbs, minimal muscle mass. cognitive and digestive benefits from protein/carb restriction noticeable despite physical limitations.\n\ndaily output: \\~12 hrs intense cognitive work, 3 hrs leisure, 2-3 hrs routine tasks, 1 hr journaling or reading.\n\nconcern:\n\nover the past 3 months, developed significant vyvanse tolerance while pursuing new job opportunity. regularly exceeding prescribed dose by up to 150% (sometimes 140mg at once). recently took >100mg daily for five consecutive days, causing severe sleep disruption. alarmingly, higher doses now feel \"normal,\" with minimal heart rate elevation and diminished euphoria. planning full abstinence this weekend, but must continue vyvanse for another month to finish critical projects.\n\nquestion:\n\nfrom your experience, does extended abstinence effectively restore baseline sensitivity after prolonged vyvanse overuse? has anyone officially been prescribed stimulants as a primary or adjunct treatment for depression? any personal insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

(just realized you can\u2019t post attachments so scratch that) i know trauma goes hand in hand to what people claim to have as \u201cdead eyes\u201d & i have undergone trauma from age 6 of witnessing a girl my age drown at my neighborhood pool while attempting to be resuscitated, my church pastor committed suicide when i was in middle school which was also a lot but i don\u2019t believe i had fathomed what actually happened at the time. after high school graduation my boyfriend committed suicide in another state. very absent father as well, i found out in 7th grade i had a half brother in japan which was from an affair on my mom which resulted in a very toxic divorce and a bit of neglect due to my mothers mental health that i\u2019ve started to come to terms with. i believe i checked out long ago but still really try to see the good in things. i\u2019m curious if this could all be a reason why i have a soulless look in my eyes. i haven\u2019t posted in a sub like this before or even acknowledged any of this really. is anyone else overly aware of their \u201cdead\u201d eyes? is there anything you do to try to appear more lively?

        "content": "how to cope when your partner is on antidepressants partner is severely depressed and on antidepressants (citalopram). he\u2019s been on them for five or so weeks, then one day got super angry, almost unrecognisable. that was around three weeks ago. he reacted to the fact that i slept a little longer in the afternoon. a few days later, he said he didn\u2019t want to be with me and fell out of love. only a couple of days before this we were making plans together. \n\nthat evening left me and our son and went to live somewhere else. he didn\u2019t want to be touched, hugged, anything. he even didn\u2019t want to be in the same house as me. left in a rage. in those early days, i tried contacting him to say that he was making a rushed decision. this relationship had flaws, but we loved each other and did everything for each other. we even fought a while ago, as he kept saying he didn\u2019t feel like doing stuff with me. but we ended up hugging and saying how much we love each other. \n\nsince then, he\u2019s been in a mental health hospital for two weeks or so. i believe it\u2019s because he\u2019s been isolating himself from people, especially his closest people, even his mom. \n\nso he\u2019s been depressed before. i\u2019m not a mental health specialist to explain, but i know about his childhood trauma. his biological mother abandoned and rejected him. his dad passed. i keep thinking that this is where his depression comes from. and it reflects on everything. and more so now, when he had recently become a father. \n \nhe asked me not to contact him if it\u2019s not about an emergency about our son. and that he needs time. and i\u2019m giving time to him. but i cannot stop thinking about him, especially now, when he is so unwell. after i messaged him to say that we care about him, he responded in an aggressive, awful way. \n\ncould these antidepressants cause this emotional emptiness? i don\u2019t know how to explain. i am hurt. lonely and shattered to pieces. and also looking after my son on my own.\n",

        "content": "double-sided post from 23f-- i'm miserable, want to die, my motivation is absolutely shot, i've gone through this cycle a billion times. and i'm going to try again even if i don't want to at all, it's really all i can do, and want to talk to others in a similar boat. i've tried to establish healthy habits and follow depression advice and i always fail. i'm easily persuaded by my vices and temptations (weed, binge eating, scrolling, etc.). i go to therapy and i can't commit and i forget to take my meds and i feel like i've got so many knots and loops in my brain that when i untangle one or just start to pick at the mass of strings it brings in another wave of pain and \"why try\". i've wanted to die for three years straight and genuinely think i'm a hopeless, empty, broken human being. i cry at everything and can't speak to people. it is almost unbearable. my brain has been trained to find the negative in everything and i try to have fun and it takes an exhausting amount of effort and then i go home and ruminate and isolate. my family has given up on me, my friends are tired, and i'm ashamed of who i am. most advice and reassurances make me feel worse, especially when given by people who don't know me. \"i'm sure you are great\" \"everyone has value\" etc. etc. i want to be someone i'm proud of and i'm not sure that i have it in me, and i sure as hell am not that person (yet?). every community i've tried to join has rejected me, every man i've ever been with has ultimately told me i'm not worth their time. people tell me i'm strange and do things weird and i'm \"quirky\"\n\nhowever, i can't kill myself. i want to so bad but i can't, i'm scared of the pain. and if i can't kill myself, i might as well try while living. it's basically my only option, and the dissonance of talking a big game about who i want to be and what i value and not following through with any of that has become more uncomfortable than wallowing and suffering.\n\nif i am going to suffer in my bed and wake up every morning crying, i might as well suffer at the gym or going on a walk or having a painful 30 minute interaction with someone. i might as well feel like absolute dog shit while doing the dishes and cleaning up the house, or attempting to focus on a page of a book while retaining nothing. i'll cry in the work bathroom and then go do my shift and mess up everyone's orders but at least i'm doing something.\n\ni'm guessing that there are other people who struggle with consistency here and have simultaneously lost all hope and any zest for life, who are completely ashamed of who they are but also go through the motions, or try to do what is supposed to be good because it's like, what else am i doing? tv or video games or movies never worked for me so maybe it's just a result of having literally 0 escapism without binging or smoking weed (i don't even like smoking weed anymore lol) but i guess it's a combo of looking good for others, seeing what i can do, and a tiny little itty bitty sliver of hope??? i don't know. i've gotten bored of my vices and they are so addictive so i'm almost trying to seek novelty in the \"good\" even if it all makes my insides feel like scrambled eggs that i'll puke up at any moment.\n\nthis probably makes no sense and i'm wondering if anyone feels this same way. i'm looking for a balance of talking about the depression side of things cuz it's fucking heavy and real and cuts through everything, but also i guess a hopeful nihilism? or just an empowering \"fuck it\". i don't know if this helps anyone but i'm looking to check in for myself and for others, and honestly a reason to keep going this morning. \n\ndisclaimer that i know everyone processes things differently and is in a different boat and has different circumstances. if you think what i'm saying is a crock of nothingness then i totally get it and keep rockin and doing what is good (or not good) for you. i know i fluctuate so much that i could read this in an hour and want to punch in my computer screen. but if this could help someone get a new perspective or connect me to likeminded-ish people that would be great.",

        "content": "brain is conditioned to suicidality hello everyone, so i wanted to ask if anyone has experienced feeling conditioned to think about dying (or hurting yourself). i have so many different triggers, and whenever i feel negative about myself or anything, the first thoughts that rush to my mind as a result are \"why am i even alive\" \"is it worth it\" \"i should just disappear\" etc. \n\n  \ni often imagine (fantasize?) about dying from a third person point of view whenever someone i care about hurts me. it's a very strange thing that i haven't even opened up to my therapist about. i think about disappearing or getting into an accident or some other gruesome thing and how that would affect the people around me. i think part of me just wants to feel valuable. another part of me wants some twisted form of revenge by guilting the other person (in my head) for hurting me. apart from these imaginary scenarios, i often think about hurting myself as some sort of immediate relief to whatever i'm feeling and also for the same goal of \"revenge\". sometimes i act on these thoughts to a minor degree, but i've been able to control them enough to not do any permanent damage. what goes through my head when i have these thoughts is \"maybe they'll give me some value now\". i just want to feel important.  \n\n  \nwhen i think about these kinds of thoughts, i can sort of rationalize them. they make sense to me and i understand why they happen and what emotional gap they're trying to fill. i'm able to do this with almost all of my feelings (not remarkable, i know, but still something i'm proud of). but what i can't seem to shake at all is this conditioned response i have to every single negative experience in my life. dying always just seems like the easier option rather than having to deal with the intensity of whatever negative emotion cocktail i'm feeling at the time. they only occur when triggered, so i don't think about suicide otherwise. it feels like my brain is wired to think like this and it makes me feel very helpless and at the mercy of these thoughts that just add more fuel to the flame. i don't want death or pain to be the first response in my head. \n\n  \nfor some context, 24f who has been chronically mentally ill since 14. late diagnosis of adhd at 19. initial diagnosis was chronic mdd, gad and ptsd. parents never let me go to therapy until i was able to afford to go on my own (around 18-19) so all these feelings fermented and festered for a solid 5 years before any intervention, and even then i wasn't consistent with therapy. i've been unwell for as long as i can remember, so i can't particularly think of a time in my life where i didn't think in this pattern. has anyone experienced this before?\n\n  \nsorry for the long rant, and thank you to anyone that read this far. i needed to get that off my chest since there's no one around me that can understand. any input, thoughts, advice or just relating is appreciated. i just want to feel less alone.

        "content": "whats the point anymore? im a 20 year old man turning 21 this year, i have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for well over 10 years now and have only recently been prescribed antidepressants. i\u2019ve been out of work since just before the end of last year and have been applying for jobs almost daily, but it\u2019s the same cycle of shit constantly, apply for a job, hear nothing back, have the rare interview, unsuccessful, apply for more jobs, hear nothing back. when i\u2019m out of a job i\u2019m stressed 24/7 about money and about everything else going on in my life and i want to kill myself. when i\u2019m in a job i have money and i\u2019m stressed about everything else in my life plus i\u2019m now stressed that my constantly deteriorating mental health will cost me my job and i still want to kill myself. what\u2019s the point in any of it? the antidepressants that i\u2019ve been on seem to do nothing, if anything things have been getting worse since i started them. i have had multiple phone calls with doctors and psychiatrists that all just dismiss whatever i\u2019m saying and give unhelpful advice. the one thing i found that makes me feel less stressed and actually feel real is cannabis, but thats expensive and i can\u2019t get a job so thats no longer an option for me. my family is broke and cant afford to give me money all the time and also provide for the rest of us. asking for money from them makes me feel horrible, social services that are put in place to help people in my position do nothing, i have been rejected from every form of social benefits i can apply for, i\u2019ve been rejected for funding from my college. i can\u2019t keep doing this, it doesn\u2019t seem to ever get better. there is no light at the end of the tunnel for me and i don\u2019t know what to do with my life i really don\u2019t see living being worth my time any more.

        "content": "[17f] impulsively ordered sn. i don't have much to say nor convey right now, for some reason i want to vent but i just don't feel like venting. i come from a very neglectful household, they are not abusive or anything, they just don't care about my mental well-being or health, i've always been dismissed since a young girl, regardless of my achievements or failures, the reactions always same. i'm close to my father, more than my mother, he stays with me often, hes over-possessive (might have anxious attachment) he tells things on impulse which hurts me a lot, he yells at me, gaslights and manipulates me. till date, i never opened up to my parents about how i felt, i tried to mold them into more understanding, i thought life would change after my first suicide attempt which was serious and had sent shock waves due to the condition which i was put in. i thought my parents would understand that i need love and affection, but nothing had changed, in-fact it became worse. my dad would fret me and often yell at me for being suicidal, id be forced to not cry at home, my mom started hating me more after that, (my mom really cares about her reputation), she only congratulates me in front of others, she does not let me talk about my interests to others who are related to her, she calls me a nerd/geek and asks me to stop talking. she never appreciates me when im alone, its either to another person when im not there, or when im present with another person. my dad wants me to stay at home 24/7, i do not have friends nor lovers, ive pretty much been lonely all my life, no one to talk with nor hug. like i said, i can not open up to my parents, they will yell at me for crying or sharing my feelings, they'll point out how im ungrateful and should learn to love this life. most of my life in school, i had a lot of guys ask me out, ended up getting groomed for around a year or something by this super senior, then i fell in love with my guy best friend (who was everything to me) he said he lost interest and left after love bombing me for months...he was everything to me at that point. i have 2-3 friends who've been with me for a couple of years, i just cant seem to open up to them emotionally like this. a lot of them are busy, we are done with highschool, of course, college and etc will take a bunch of your time. but it is hell, to now go out my 4 walls, not have anyone to call and talk with, hear other people's voices, no pets...nothing. i have no purpose of life, i want to improve but, i just dont have the motivation to, i've been trying to ctb for the last week, unfortunately. the last 2 years were good to be honest, i was much better than what i was before, i thought i wasnt depressed, i just overcame it, i stopped medication and everything was fine...just fine, i was so happy. ever since i stopped going to school and now that its been almost 5-6 months since im at my house alone, with no social interaction or anything, these thoughts have been coming again, it is haunting me, the leaving of my ex boyfriend is hurting me even more, he was quite literally everything for me, i opened up emotionally to him and only him, we've known each other for 3 years, and i've been extremely transparent to him for these 3 years, told him things i wouldnt tell anyone, now i just have no one for me, its just ultra lonely now, i literally have no one for me, all i had was him, which is selfish because in his life, he has people, he has his friends, his parents, his sister whome he can open up with if he wanted to. me? lol. idk why men like me until they date me. idk why i can get used for love but never get it returned\n\ni relapsed on self harm a week or two ago, everythings just piled up on my head, i was so proud of myself for not hurting myself again, but now its just starting all over again i fucking hate it, ive been depressed my whole life i feel like a fucking failiure, i cant have anybody know about this irl, they'd just be tired of me \" shes always sad \". \" she always hurts herself \", im so done with it, i just want to die right now, i literally just want to die. i have nothing to have hope for in my life, i might be young but this is torture and hell, the academic stress + 4 dark walls + no social life, i tried my best but i just feel so fucking alone, so fucking scared, i dont want to study, i dont want to do anything alone, like god please i just want to have somebody to be behind me just giving me comfort, like bro the other day someone called me a sweetheart and i fucking started bawling my eyes out. i just dont feel real anymore, nothing feels real, everyone just ignores my existence, im important to no body, its not like i want to be, but it would be nice to be noticed and loved, cared for, remembered. \n\ni've been on ss for a while, few weeks after the breakup, i ended up ordering sn today after my dad yelling at me for bad handwriting (and because i didnt accept it was bad, it was my last straw because he keeps pointing out things which are insignificant for no reason, and hes the reason why im like this, depressed and lonely.) its been a while, i think i might cancel the order, i just...im scared of what i might do out of impulse next, i have an important exam coming soon, ive been studying day and night not caring about anything in the world, if i felt sad, id just sob on the paper and keep going it literally became my only thing to do in life right now, but i swore to myself that if i am not getting the desired mark i want i will deffo ctb, it is not something i can shoo away as well, i mean if not after results, it will deffo happen sometime later, i just want to escape, this hell. \n\nyou might think that i would move out and go to newer classes irl? no...not happening, my dad decided to use online coaching (pre-recorded) for the next 1.5 years for my next exam which happens in 2026. another 1.5 years inside these walls, not going out (even for food, he prefers doordash over actually going to restaurants)\n\ni just want my boyfriend back atleast man, atleast he was there for me when i was sad, at least i felt comfortable with him if not my own parents and friends. but he had to be such an a-hole.

        "content": "needing support because i am getting so close to that deep dark pit again tldr: life is just so hard. and so stressful. and it really really feels like i just suck at living. please send encouragement. \n\nand i work with my therapist to recognize that i am human. and i know that i am not meant to be a cog in the machine. no human is. i am meant to be out in nature, not confined to the hell that is capitalism, not confined to clothes, not confined to anything i wouldn\u2019t expect an ape to do. but every time i remember that, i get just so angry. and that anger turns to sadness real quick. \n\ni\u2019m coming out of a trauma-versary right now, the worst of that is past, but today i just got laid off from my job after being the sickest i have been in years. i took off two days. two days is long enough for the parents of the kid i nanny to try daycare and find that it\u2019s a better option for the kid. which i get. trust me i do. it just really really sucks to have happened right now. \n\nmy partner and i have also been planning on moving in together, and my anxiety has been having a heyday with that knowledge. i\u2019ve been so worried about moving in and him getting sick of me in large amounts. i\u2019m trying to take his word at face value and give him more trust as a person over all, per his gentle request. he is just so patient and understanding. and he deserves so much more than what i can offer him right now. he deserves less stress. but i\u2019m trying to trust in \u201cus\u201d right now before making any decisions that you can\u2019t easily come back from (like breaking up). \n\ni\u2019m also trying to get used to my new cpap machine, but i\u2019ve now had two panic attacks while trying to wear it. i know i need to do some erp therapy to help with it, but with this whole process of getting diagnosed with sleep apnea, getting treatment for it, and now trying to make the treatment work, it has just been obstacle after obstacle after obstacle every step of the way. it\u2019s very disheartening. \n\ni also am bad at taking my medication regularly. think missing a morning and/or night like 2-3 times a week. i promise i\u2019m trying you guys. and i know how important it is. i can\u2019t explain it, but i don\u2019t feel like myself when i\u2019m on it, but without it, i can\u2019t even lift my metaphorical tools in my tool-belt that help me fight anxiety and depression. i\u2019m incredibly more prone to panic attacks that end up putting more stress on myself and the relationships i\u2019ve worked so hard to keep in my life. \n\ni can\u2019t seem to eat healthy because half the time, i\u2019m trying to just get myself to eat literally anything. and there are just so many complex things surrounding exercise. i know that it would have so many benefits to my life, but panic disorder and exercise induced asthma (among the many things that stop me from exercising) make exercising a bitch. \n\npoint in all this is that it all feels never ending and i feel like i\u2019m never going to make it. the state of the world and the state of the usa where i live doesn\u2019t help. i\u2019m so tired of trying and trying and trying everyday to look behind me and see that i haven\u2019t moved an inch. or maybe even worse, i\u2019ve moved 5 inches, but all of the therapy and medication and support i have told me that i would move 5 miles once i got the right treatment and the treatment kicked in. but it\u2019s been months since starting medications, and the cpap machine is impacting my sleep worse than the sleep apnea was. \n\ni would love some encouragement from y\u2019all, who i know understand this experience because you live it as well. i feel so close to checking myself into some iop or iip, and while that could be helpful, would also be setting me back, undoing years of progress i have made since my last iop. it would put so much strain on me socially and financially. i just don\u2019t want to go through all that again. i hope i\u2019m not the only one who feels this way, and i am open to hearing about how you might deal with some of these things/resources i could look into myself. thanks everyone \u2665\ufe0f",

it\u2019s literally a mess. there is garage and clothes everywhere and i feel like a disgusting pig living in a dumpster. i\u2019ve honestly never felt more disgusted with myself in my life. my budgeting has gotten out of control. i'm spending money like crazy because i can't cope. i don't have time for my friends. i don't have time for my hobbies. i feel stressed and anxious all the time. i'm pulling several all-nighters some nights. i'm only getting three hours of sleep because i'm so anxious, or i simply can't sleep. \n\nand it shouldn't be this hard because i do online. i do community college, but i can't handle it. and i don't know if it would have been different if i had gone somewhere far away, but i took a gap year. and mental health is too bad to leave home. and my first semester was fine, but i hated it. and my second semester, within the first two weeks, i dropped out of a class without telling my parents. and i feel so guilty about it, but i'll pay them back. and my parents are paying for all my education, even though i told them not to, because i feel even more obligated to finish it. and i am more than enough money to afford four years of education anywhere i wanna go because i worked my ass off in high school. i worked for 50 hours a week sometimes just to save up. but i don't want to go to college anymore. i never did want to go. i told them i didn't want to go, but they're afraid i'll end up like my drug-addicted uncle, because he didn't go to college either. but it's getting so bad that i'm starting to self-harm again.\n\ni remember the day that i told my parents i wanted to take a gap here they sat me in front of the computer and chose my major for me and i cried for hours. and when time does sign up for classes came around i just didn\u2019t do it because i didn\u2019t wanna go so they told me i had to go in the fall and i didn\u2019t go and then they said this summer and i didn\u2019t do it and then they finally said the fall again so i started and i had to quit my fucking job but i loved. and don\u2019t get me wrong the pay and job was kind of shit. i was working insane hours. i was breaking out in hives, but i was at least having fun in my room wasn\u2019t a mess. i wasn\u2019t spending money like crazy and i was remembering to eat and sleep like a normal person.\n\nand i\u2019m just so mad at myself because if i listened to my own instinct and kept working my ass off and saving money, i could\u2019ve been moved out by now, but i didn\u2019t do that and now i feel stuck. i don\u2019t even have access to my savings anymore because it\u2019s in my parent\u2019s account and they never told me that it was their account so i don\u2019t even know how to get my money.

(to whom he's been with over 40 years) and he gave me words of encouragement before he walked out. my grandpa has got me through some really rough shit and he is the reason i will keep going always. words can't describe how much i love him.",

        "content": "when it gets better? hey everyone,\n\ni would like to share my experience what i now think is depression.\n\ni have always had very comfortable life, no major issues. year ago i had first relationship when i was 24. it ended after 3 months.\ni really couldnt deal with it well. \n\ni have never been very confident and all my selfworth was tied to my money. after break up i also was looking for a job. it took 3months to find one. during that time i was really low. none of selworth or anything and i needed to be distracted all the time. that distraction was casino. eventually i lost all my money.\n\n\nits been few months. i have a job, but it will take time to save the money i lost. i have never been in this situation.\n\nbut the worst thing is crippling anxiety, sadness and loneliness i feel almost all the time. i am nowhere near where i want to be financially and career wise. i know it takes time but i dont want to suffer so much a long the way.\n\nmy social life is quite the same as it always been but since the break up i feel lonely all the time. meeting someone new and starting a new relationship is highly unlikely. its so sad that i have to pay for intimacy (erotic massage) and its the only thing i look forward to.\n\n\noverall i feel like i am going nowhere, achieve nothing and will end up alone. sometimes i even break down crying (for 24 years i rarely cried).\n\ni would like to hear some advice or if u managed to turn your life around. i also lnow that my life isnt objectively bad and i am just 25 with no debt. but it doesnt help me feel any good.",

        "content": "just a vent i\u2019m 29 years old this year. i have literally nothing but ongoing addiction and mental health issues to show for it. no skills or finances to go to try and get an education. my mother recently died a long painful death. i\u2019m struggling horribly with the bereavement and with having to really be an adult for the first time. \ni don\u2019t have the balls to tackle my addiction, i have a girlfriend who is supportive in a lot of ways but i know she\u2019s looking for a way out of the relationship. and i don\u2019t blame her. i can\u2019t stop myself from fucking my life up worse\u2026 \n\nmy partner who is legitimately my only living person who i think is close to me. doesn\u2019t open up, is probably so sick of dealing with my shit that she doesn\u2019t really seem to be bothered about my mental health anymore and seems to take any chance possible to not spend time with me. infidelity on her part has been on the cards multiple times and i know it\u2019s only a matter of time before i push her into it if i haven\u2019t already. (strongly believe she has but of course she doesn\u2019t trust me enough to be open about this sort of thing.)\n\nas of right now she\u2019s more or less the only thing i care about or have in life anymore and i\u2019m really starting to believe that she can\u2019t be happy with me and i can\u2019t be happy without her.\n\nwhat should i get in order to make sure that she does manage to end up happy? would just breaking up with her make it seem like all the effort she did put in was pointless? being in the mindset that she\u2019s more or less over me, would a decent life insurance policy and just taking myself to a place with less pain really hurt her if it was enough for her to be set and find someone that actually makes her happy? \n\nand incase maybe i haven\u2019t made it clear, i do treasure this woman but on multiple times she\u2019s made it clear that this feelings are not reciprocated. that\u2019s on me, i can\u2019t imagine anyone would actually manage to be happy with me being a major part of their life.\n\ni am not looking for sympathy, empathy as i don\u2019t deserve it. i just want to find some kind of end to my pain without hurting those i love anymore than i already do.",

        "content": "what am i even doing with my life? honestly, i'm (23f) just depressed and having a hard time figuring out how to get my life together. i finished undergrad in may of 2023, but was unemployed (not by choice) until this past september, so i was severely depressed for over a year- just feeling like i was useless and have no real purpose in life. i'm happy with the work i'm doing now, but it's remote and i very rarely see coworkers, so i feel really alone during the day. things started to get slightly better in september also because i got married to my partner (27f) of 4 years. she makes me incredibly happy and i know we both want to spend forever together, but we both suffer from depression, anxiety, and adhd. meanwhile, she also has pretty bad ptsd and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia before we even met. i'm in therapy and on meds for everything, however, my wife only recently got back on concerta for her adhd, and that's it. i really think her mental and physical health issues are taking a toll on our relationship as she is almost always tired/in pain and sad and i just hate seeing her like this. we live in a city about 90 minutes from family and we barely have any friends, so we're quite isolated and i'm not sure what to do. i just want us to be happy. any advice on how to improve my quality of life and make things better for my wife and i?",

        "content": "depression feels incredibly selfish i attend a top university, have a promising future, have a supportive family, and have lived an incredibly privileged life. i have received literally everything i have ever asked for. so it\u2019s only fair i achieve great things to make my family proud\u2014which i have. but that\u2019s the only good thing about me. i\u2019m nothing without my achievements. i\u2019m not talented in anything but academia. i\u2019m not super attractive compared to my family members. i\u2019m known for my rigid and gloomy personality, which costed my social life since elementary school. \n\ni\u2019ve always been the weird person who played with puzzles and read books alone in the corner of the room. so i think that\u2019s why i got physically bullied in elementary school. i came home with a lot of wounds because i constantly got tripped. girls used me as their punching bag bc they thought it was funny, so i came home with large bruises on my arms. i lied to my parents at such a young age, saying it was self-inflicted. i got laughed at a lot in middle school, but thankfully i had friends by then. my teachers always liked me, but they always pitied me because i was unable to socialize with my peers. i kept this to myself because of the shame i felt bc it\u2019s virtually my fault for being such a weak person.\n\nit sucks seeing my friends and family members constantly being liked for their talents, personality, and attractiveness. i have nothing but school. \n\nwhen i had a glow up in college, i received an overwhelming amount of male attention (for the first time). but each one of them said the same thing about me: i\u2019m \u201cpure\u201d, a good daughter, etc.\n\ni know those aren\u2019t bad things, but that\u2019s all i am. i\u2019m not funny, i\u2019m not beautiful, nor am i special. \n\npeople (even my friends and family) joke that i\u2019m severely antisocial. random people i don\u2019t even know address me as the \u201cgirl who is awkward and doesn\u2019t socialize\u201d. my friends and family warn me to not be so shy and awkward in front of new people. \n\ni feel like my family only loves me because i\u2019m the model daughter. i never act out, i do well in my studies, etc. in other words, i\u2019m boring. \n\ni feel so empty inside all the time. nothing ever excites me anymore. i have to force a smile all the time. i can\u2019t sleep. i can\u2019t even cry. i don\u2019t even feel sadness nor empathy for anyone and anything. all i feel is frustration. \n\ni\u2019ve been really unwell before, like borderline manic, but i think i\u2019ve reached a point where my mind and body just accepted it. i\u2019m scared i\u2019ll live an unfulfilling life all because i care too much of what my family thinks of me. i\u2019m scared i\u2019ll get married to a man i don\u2019t like and have children i will hate. honestly, that sounds like a realistic life trajectory for me.\n\ni wish i had the courage to express myself. but i don\u2019t know who i truly am. i don\u2019t even know myself. i have constantly adjusted my personality to others\u2019 liking. i don\u2019t know who i am when i\u2019m alone. \n\nthis whole thing is so hypocritical too. i grew up extremely privileged, so i don\u2019t know what true hardship is like. so that\u2019s why living with constant emptiness feels selfish. i should be happy. i hope one day i\u2019ll just be happy with who i am. \n",

(they abused me as a child.) i feel so alone. no one to talk to. i have a therapist but she sucks. i\u2019ve also been struggling so bad with my anxiety to the where i\u2019ve been myself sick. i hate this life. i don\u2019t want to live this way but i don\u2019t know what to do. if i leave my job, i\u2019ll have no way to pay rent or utilities. please, does anyone else feel this way?

        "content": "an approximate timeline of  my experience with depression. unfortunately, i can\u2019t give you exact details because i have a terrible memory and can barely remember much from a week ago. anyway, i\u2019ll try my best to fix a coherent story. \n\n2019-2021\napart from struggling with becoming a teenager, i had many issues at home with my parents. my mom and dad would argue a lot and a lot of their anger was taken out on me. obviously, i grew to be sensitive to loud noises and situations that involved arguments as a result of their attitude. anyways, around this time covid hit and everything went digital. i became chronically online and that started to affect me greatly. i began questioning my identity around this time and having an existential crisis. on top of that, my parent\u2019s relationship began getting tenser. \n\ni\u2019d spend long hours alone in my room because i was in over my head. i also wanted to avoid my parents. my sleep schedule drastically became worse. for context i\u2019d stay up to 4am and not get enough sleep afterwards. i could feel my cognitive abilities worsen as i became terrible at recalling things and would find it really difficult concentrating. for example, i would spend at least 10 minutes reading just 1 sentence from a book because i couldn\u2019t properly comprehend it. my appetite also worsened. i don\u2019t remember much of the things i ate but i do know that i barely did. \n\ni used to feel quite numb back then. i couldn\u2019t get a kick out of things as well as i used to before. i felt that no one cared for me and that i didn\u2019t deserve to live because i was hurting those around me. i got a therapist around this time but the sessions didn\u2019t last for long because they were quite expensive. i think i began to grow a healthier mindset around this time. however, things only started getting worse.\n\n2022-2023\nso late 2021-early 2022 i began to self harm and became suicidal. i had many moments where i was very close to attempting. now story time. i woke up for school like any other day on a tuesday morning (that i remember lol). i was about to head downstairs when i heard my parents arguing again. it was way more aggressive this time around though. i heard my dad throwing things and screaming louder than i\u2019ve ever heard him scream. i felt scared and didn\u2019t want to go down but if i remember correctly, my mom ended up going up to call me. i went in the living room and that\u2019s when my dad started shouting again. this time he started saying some pretty hurtful things to me. anyways i balled my eyes out on my way to school and made the decision that everything that\u2019s been happening is my fault and that i\u2019m going to end my life. later on at school i decided to confide in a close friend of mine in hopes of her changing my mind. i ended up having an emotional breakdown in front of her and she decided that she was going to tell my mom what\u2019s been going on with me (she found out i was self harming). she ended up talking to my mom and by that time my mom had also told my aunt about the argument she had with my dad. i went to my aunts place that day and i ended up living there for about a week. however, i was still planning on ending things until this one day i decided that i wanted to tell a friend of mine that i liked her. i thought that i had nothing left to lose so i might as well tell her, right? surprisingly, she liked me too and that changed my perspective surrounding so many things. i hadn\u2019t \u201cfelt\u201d a thing in so long and somehow this girl was able to make me feel something. i began to crave talking to her. i felt my heart wrench at the thought of her. \n\nafter a while, my family decided it was best if i travelled to my home country for treatment and to have a change in environment. my mom and i travelled on the 1st of march. i spent 6 months over there and jumped from therapist to therapist until i stuck to one. i was prescribed an ssri antidepressant which i took for about a year and a half. i started feeling things, yay!\n\ni loved my time there. i didn\u2019t have socials and i didn\u2019t use my devices much around then. i spent my time bonding with my relatives, nature and just the community around me. however, my confidence and self esteem greatly dropped around then and when i traveled back to my birth country i couldn\u2019t properly enhance and interact with others. i became much more self critical and analyzed everything heavily which helped foster a great environment for my anxiety :) \n\nfast forward 2023, although i\u2019m not stacking lots of cheese and making money (props to whoever gets this reference), i\u2019m doing better, supposedly? i began to work on my mindset surrounding depression and anxiety. i befriended a few more people and socialized more. my confidence grew a bit as a result. i started meditating and using affirmative words to describe myself. it worked for a bit, until i quit taking my meds. at first i didn\u2019t think it affected me that much, but now i realize that maybe that\u2019s the reason i relapsed? anyways i don\u2019t remember much from this year. just that i got better around early and mid 2023 and then began to decline around late 2023. \n\n2024-now\ni\u2019d say 2024 was one of my favorite years as i discovered a lot about myself and felt that i had matured and grown from my past experiences. i had a lot of fun with family and friends. i started to focus more on my studies and genuinely liked my life and where it was headed. however, there was still a growing internal war within me. around mid-late 2024 i realized that i became a more sensitive person (hsp? idk) and began having random emotional outbursts. around that time i was studying hard for an exam i had to retake (i did well on it btw), but after the exams were over i got burned out. i realized that after doing the same thing over and over again that i became more prone to burnout. for a while i couldn\u2019t exactly pin point what was happening to me. i felt empty and hollow. i was doing so perfectly, as far as i knew but there still wasn\u2019t something right. \n \n(sorry this next paragraph is quite messy)\ni don\u2019t think i fully went in depth of the things i internally went/ still go through. i mostly wanted to give an overview of each year before jumping to that. i\u2019ve always been a very curious kid. when i was younger, i\u2019d spend much of my time playing alone doing the things i loved doing the most. i loved reading a lot and so i\u2019d spend hours on end re reading all the books i had. i never got bored. i always had enthusiasm for what the future held and passions for what i wanted to become. much of those feelings i had are no longer there. i still love all of these things but i\u2019ve lost the kick i used to get doing them. the hobbies i once loved are things i avoid doing now because i\u2019m afraid of how much i\u2019d be disappointed at being a failure at loving my own hobbies. i used to play on my guitar so much but lately i\u2019ve been avoiding to. who the hell avoids their hobbies. it doesn\u2019t make any sense. i used to enjoy being around people even when they made me feel anxious, but now i hate it more than anything because i\u2019m genuinely tired of the person i\u2019ve become around others. i always try to mold myself into a specific person when i\u2019m with people and it always ends up in me feeling terribly about myself. i don\u2019t know what gets into me. my mind feels like a circuit filled with an infinite amount of tangled wires. my thoughts zoom about so quickly that i lose track of the original thought if there ever was one. i self criticize so much and it has affected how i communicate with others. for example yesterday i was being asked something by my teacher and i literally just blanked out. like i know what to say, i just can\u2019t seem to put it into words. i\u2019ve been dissociating a lot lately too. \n\ni can\u2019t seem to be good at anything.\ni like so many things and have so many hobbies, but i\u2019m not even a jack of all trades. what even am i. i can\u2019t seem to create meaning for myself. i don\u2019t think i\u2019m a nihilist but i\u2019m starting to find things quite meaningless. i\u2019m not suicidal but everyday i wish i wasn\u2019t born. what went wrong? i\u2019ve been doing things so well, but i can\u2019t even remember what i did to get to that point. did i fall into the same hole twice or was it always there. i\u2019m starting to think i never healed. i feel i\u2019m mentally declining. i can literally feel it. i used to be so sharp. i don\u2019t feel understood at all. i don\u2019t even understand myself. i don\u2019t know why i\u2019m like this. there\u2019s no reason for me to be like this. my parents have become a great support system and they don\u2019t argue like they used to before. we\u2019re not poor. we have a nice house and great relatives. people like me. so what went wrong? \n\ni don\u2019t remember exactly when i started feeling this way again but i always avoided the idea of depression. i didn\u2019t want to accept that i was feeling that way because there is no reason for me to be. people have it worse. and because i had no word to describe these feelings i felt even more lost. saying i\u2019m depressed now makes more sense. even when writing this i feel like an imposter. like all these things are normal to feel and everyone feels like this. i\u2019ve gotten so used to these feelings that i believed for so long that it was normal to feel this way. i saw all of it backfire by having recurring mental breakdowns. it would start with me feeling incredibly emotional for no reason and then begin to uncontrollably cry for an hour or so. \n\ni\u2019m graduating from hs in 2 months. maybe that\u2019s fueling all these emotions. i\u2019m afraid i\u2019ll carry this same person with me into my new life and that i wouldn\u2019t be able to depend on myself due to that. i have so many unresolved issues that i\u2019m not even sure i\u2019m ready to do any of this. i\u2019ve literally been ignoring the fact that i\u2019m graduating. everyone else has finished their applications and i still haven\u2019t even prepared my documents. i feel so spoiled and lazy. how am i supposed to live life with all these thoughts wizzing around. i\u2019m truly not an effective human. i\u2019m not built for this cruel world. i\u2019m not a strong person at all. i\u2019m very very sensitive and get burned out immediately, like i\u2019ve already mentioned. i still have goals that i want to achieve and i\u2019m going to keep on trying to heal, even though i have no fucking idea what i\u2019m doing. \n\nwould love to read some advice from older folks or people who went/are going through something similar. i\u2019m trying my best to stray away from therapy so you don\u2019t need to mention that. \n\nsummary:\ni was depressed. i\u2019m depressed again. i\u2019m brain dead and living life idly. any advice?",

        "content": "my life is out of control i\u2019m not a lazy person, but i find it incredibly hard to push myself to work and do something significant. my entire conscious life, i have been completely dependent on my family, who provided for my education and everything else. i never really had a childhood\u2014no socializing with other kids, no freedom\u2014just endless studying and activities i hated, which drained every part of me.\n\ni was always burdened with extreme responsibility, so i never experienced my teenage years the way i should have. my life felt like an endless hell of suffering, and it seemed like it would never end.\n\nthen, someone came into my life. someone who had almost nothing but still pulled me out of that hell\u2014at the cost of their own health and personal life. they took me under their wing, helped me in every possible way. but in the end, we both ended up trapped. we had an agreement: in return for all this help, we would work together on a major project.\n\nbut i kept resisting. i was so exhausted from working like crazy and being torn between two extremes: staying in the familiar pain or stepping into something new, knowing there would be no turning back. and now, for over a year, we haven\u2019t been actively working on anything. i haven\u2019t brought in a single cent or a single client\u2014though i\u2019ve created incredible designs, marketing materials, and more.\n\nmy resistance comes from my fear of independence, my fear of taking responsibility for myself. i have no addictions, except for one\u2014i endlessly eat and waste my energy on meaningless social interactions. no one knows what i\u2019m really going through. i realize that i\u2019m behaving like a parasite, like a child who refuses to grow up. but after years of endless suffering, moving toward success and independence feels unbearably painful.\n\nyou get so used to the violence, to the struggle, that the mere idea of another life doesn\u2019t just seem impossible\u2014it feels unbearable.\n\ni don\u2019t know what to do. i have a deadline in two days, and i have nothing to show for it. i feel like i\u2019m making the biggest mistake of my life, and i don\u2019t know how to recover. please, help me. i feel completely lost.",

        "content": "ex got with someone else and i didn't expect it to hurt this much. depression is now back in full swing i (20) was seeing a girl (21) when she had visited my country as an international student last year. we clicked very quickly and it was the most amazing and fulfilling relationship. it lasted for about 6 months\n however, towards the end of the year, she had to return to her home country across the world, and gave me an ultimatum of doing long distance (for god knows how long... 2 years at least, until we had both finished our degrees and had enough money to fly over to each other) or ending the relationship there. i chose to end the relationship. it seemed like such a monumental task to do long distance for so long. it obviously hurt her but we stayed in contact and remained good friends. fast forward 4-5 months to last week, after a period of a not talking for a few weeks she reached out and told me she was seeing someone else, and that this person was of the same gender as her, and that she is now identifying as queer. i am happy she has found someone who makes her happy, and it honestly brings a tear to my eye to see her smile and she deserves a mountain of happiness. i just didn't think about what i lost a few months ago when i said no to her - and now it's collapsing onto me like a pile of bricks. i don't want to text her and tell her how i feel, because it's inappropriate, and i'm just forced to wallow in my grief. i woke up this morning and she had removed me on all social media despite her saying she wished to continue talking as friends the night before.\n\ni feel as though my depression is back in full swing and has been for the last week or so. i've dropped pretty much everything and i'm back to being restless at night and wishing i made different life choices. sometimes it feels like she was the only person who actually cared about me, or maybe i'm just looking through rose tinted glasses. either way, i'm a complete mess and i feel as though my thoughts about ending my own life are slowly returning.\n\n:(",

        "content": "i don't feel like i exist i guess to start off, i don't really know what this is or what i'm doing, but i feel like i need to talk about myself to someone, anyone. i don't know i anyone is interested in reading people's depressing life stories, but i just felt like i had to put something out there in the world, even if no one will read it. \ni'm apparently turning 22 this year. i have no friends, no positive or meaningful relationships with anyone including family, and i don't really feel like i exist anymore. as a kid up to the age of 12 i was physically and emotionally abused and neglected. from the time i was born til pretty much now still i have constantly moved from place to place to place, from school to school. the longest amount of time i've ever really been anywhere was for about 3 years max. naturally those things mixed together with an already shy kid makes it hard to make friends and socially develop. i've had very few \"friends\" in my life, more like short term acquaintances rather than anything really meaningful. i've experienced an endless list of trauma since i was a kid, including but not limited to finding my stepfather dead after he committed suicide at 10, dealing with a mother who was emotionally and physically neglectful who had a drinking problem and has attempted suicide in front of me, and while many people wouldn't consider moving as a trauma, never having a true home or security or a stable place to even attempt to make friends has been prevalent my entire life. i've never dated or been in a romantic relationship. as someone who is closeted, it's already hard enough to be able to date and have friends that you can relate to. the only physical touch or intimacy i've ever really had in life was meeting grown men 2-3 times my age online for sex, whiched started a long time before i became legal age. over the years i've accumulated multiple diagnoses: depression, generalized anxiety, dpdr, social anxiety, body dysmorphia, ptsd, panic disorder, etc. i never really got to be a kid or teenager. throughout that time i'd always tell myself \"when i'm (age) things will be better\" and everytime i'd reach that point it had only gotten worse. 13, 15, 16, 18, 21. now i'm apparently 22. for the last 2 years i've been sitting in my apartment doing online college ndwoking a couple overnight shifts a week at a gas station. i can't go out because i don't have a license and can't drive, and my body dysmorphia and social anxiety is so bad i can't even work the day shift. i dont know if anyone who's reading this has ever experienced dpdr (derealization/depersonalization) but my existence has been a constant state of derealization and dissociation since the age of 14. up until a few months ago it was mostly just the derealization, but now it's severe depersonalization as well, which basically feels like everyday i wake up and i have someone else's memories and i have to be okay with not really being a person. my anxiety and panic used to be so severe, but now my body and mind are just so tired and worn down that all i feel is constant existential dread. i've completely dissociated my entire teen years and now i'm supposedly in my twenties somehow and i don't understand. something i did or saw a couple months ago was actually 3 years ago. the last few months i've had this realization i guess you could call it of my on mortality, that at basically any point i could die and there would have been no point to it all. i don't know what's worse, dying now having lived this miserable existence without ever truly living, or dying having done the same things for so much longer. i have so many issues, but i feel like s many of them could have been \"fixed\" by such simple things like having a best friend or anyone that really cared about me to be there, but i'll never have that. i feel like i'm already dead, but i'm still terrified of the concept of death. i don't really know why i wrote all of this. it's not like anyone can change the past or fix my current situation. i guess i just wanted to put a part of myself out there so i'm not so alone.

        "content": "7 months of ssri withdrawals. also a long story about being a self conscious teenager on ssris. i cannot stretch this enough, do not try to pull wisdom from my text here. ssris affect people differently and has uses for different periods of your life. this is not an anti-medicine claim.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\ni am still shamed of this but for the first time in 5 years i feel like i can talk about this. let me give you some context...\n\ni was diagnosed with social anxiety, depression and bdd at the age of 16. my bdd was connected to feeling like people could see my weakness on my face and my body, i felt small and short and too feminine to the point i would take thousands of photos carefully decyphering if i was ugly . there was some truth to it, i was a pretty feminine and small looking guy and i felt a huge pressure to be masculine. it got to the point that i started looking for drugs and treatments for my body and face, looking at hormonal levels(i actually got it checked). and unfortunately, i actually found a working method. the technique that is well known as \"mewing'\" today on social media is what i found, somehow. there was still not any proof online that it worked but i was too desperate to not try. either way, this became an insane obsession when it did change my face. during this time i was also prescribed ssris. this is very important in this story, that the ssris were prescribed almost right after i found out about my new obsession. \n\nthe days of doing this turned into months, which turned into years. during this time i also grew an ego. i felt more and more confident, so i put all my energy on going to the gym. it was insane the power i felt and i get how my unconfident teen self felt saved in this feeling. \n\nhere is also where it gets ugly. i started connecting my whole life, my whole history to this practice of getting stronger and more masculine. so i wanted everything in my day to be masculine things. the things i watched, the porn, the food, the people i hung out with, my dreams(for the future) and extremely... extremely sexist. of course it had to become sexist. it was like anything that sounded good in my head, i took for a fact since.. well i'm just gonna get more handsome by the day so who could really have an opinion that mattered but mine? i was gonna be the hottest man on earth. i wanna leave this part because it makes me sad til this day that there is this greed and hate inside me on some level that made me believe this.\n\nafter 1,5 years of working out i felt ready to talk to women. i'm not even gonna mention that i had my first girlfriend during this time, cause i treated her really badly. i look back and feel sorry for her, cause she really needed a good supportive person during that time of her life. so i dumped her and almost immediately went to the gym to talk to people i thought myself \"worthy\" of. dont worry, this next moment will stop this behaviour. cause 7 days prior to this, i quit my ssri... i had gotten so delusional i didn't even think for a second that i needed it anymore, i was saved after all and a super hero of a man.. why would i need a stupid medicine.\n\n**panick attack at the gym** right when mustering the courage to talk to some people. feeling defeated but also understanding that it has always been hard for me, i just gotta try again tomorrow. **panick attack the same night.**  starting to feel an insane confusion when waking up, not at all ready to hit the gym. the next days were filled with extreme cases of anxiety and suicidism. from going from this godlike state of being to begging to be killed withing 3 days is a feeling i've mostly blocked, but it was like i was punished by all gods at the same time. when i tell you this, i'm being serious. it got so bad i couldn't move. i tried making my way down to the kitchen to grab a knife but i got so dizzy i made it three meters from the bed. there was no time, no context and no understanding. just a sharp pain spreading across my heart and my head. i told my parents the morning after when i've been up all night in this state. but this was actually not the worst part, it would come later, a month later actually. so i didn't unalive myself, luckily because my parents were with me 24/7. \n\ngoing back on the medicine didn't help, since i told them, they made me eat it again. a total of 10 days or so without the medicine. i felt some relief, the pounding in my heart eased out during the day yet i was extremely tired, in pain and depressed. but then the anxiety came back, just more slowly this time and in a more psychological way. and it peaked in the car driving to our summerhouse where i felt as if i was falling. the sensation of falling while sitting in the car made me start convulsing and shaking and screaming, my dad pulled out to the side of the road. he had to grab me out of the car and hold me hard while comforting me. this is the absolute most horrific thing i've ever felt and my heart goes to people who deals with this often. i think there was 7 seconds or so where i couldn't breathe. my muscles cramped up so i couldn't breathe. i was somewhat relieved because i started feeling as if i was fading or  dying. \n\nafter this nothing has peaked over that which i guess has made me not care about fainting or panick attacks anymore, cause i can always compare it to then. the following years contained alot of substance abuse, hopelessness and agony. \n\nbut slowly i started understanding life as a teen should have, but in my 20s. i started breaking down my sexist and hateful mindset together with my favourite person in the world, my psychiatrist. i've seen him now for 4 years. i got to learn to be honest. to be imperfect and afraid. i did some serious work to fix things cause i was sick of the constant pain and hopefulness. i didn't understand why it never got as bad as that day in the car again but i felt grateful. my enjoyment didnt improve however... even if i could go to extreme legths to break down old habits with healthy ones, i even met my first love :). and here comes the finale in this story.\n\nno matter how awesome i did, i ended up not being able to keep pushing my new routines. there were always this constant anxiety in the background. it was a constant feeling of knowing i won't ever make it. sometimes i wished i listened to those words in my head, but also i didn't wanna give up because i took it as negativity. the only moments i felt i could not think of that anxiety was in alcohol and nicotine which took me down a 3 year long addiction to substances, including weed, ketamine and cocaine. i chose the substances over my first real love. so i felt... like i could never take myself seriously after that. after that was a year closer to death that i've ever been. instead of feeling insane anxiety i just felt nothing. not my heartbeat nor my thoughts. i tried over and over half-assed to stop but eventually gave in. i started harming myself and practicing drinking heavy amounts of alcohol to push myself over the edge and hope to dare to end it. i had stopped my anti-psychotics a month prior and now didn't even take my ssri. three days after quitting my ssri(i think) i just laid in bed, i didn't have the motivation to die anymore. i don't remember how many hours, i just remember the sun setting and going down. not even drinking or using nicotine. but then i felt something. this was a strange feeling, feeling anything at all in my body. the visual explanation is a glimmer from a needle surrounded by a void. so there was something. something existed in my world all of a sudden and i didn't understand. but i started speculating, which was also something strange cause my thoughts normally came as pictures in my head, hallucinations if you will. was there a possibility that my ssri, somehow made me feel nothing.. and that this glimmer in my head is the absence of it? i swore to try at least one week. the 4th day i felt so optimistic that i started thinking about quitting more potentially harming things from my life. the 5th day i were able to get out of bed and game a little on my computer. the 6th was the day i started seriously regaining my consciousness. i knew i couldn't let this opportunity pass with my life. so i went through withdrawals, 11 days in a psychiatric hospital. yet i always felt a sense of hope that grew incredibly slowly. paranoia, anxiety and sleeplessness for 3 months straight, but everyday unlocking something new. i am now 7 months in withdrawals. i haven't touched a single substance except alcohol this weekend since 11 days. which is good compared to 5 lines, half a pack of snus, alcohol to put me to sleep without breaks per day.\n\ni spent the recent weekend visiting the town i live in alone, looking at shops and walking in a national park. i smile and look at everyone i meet with fascination. i bought a burger from a fancy-pancy restaurant and asked for a takeaway from the cool bartender, cause i wanted to watch attack on titan so badly at home. i sat there on the floor completely perplexed by the show with my burger in the hand when the evening came and just thought.. \"wow am i allowed to feel this way? to feel.. safe and comfortable?\"\n\ni'm still confused and in a lot of stress, don't get me wrong. either i am right now riding another delusion or things are just more correct without the medicine. but this seems real. i might just be okay for now. i felt ready to tell anyone about all of this, plus i'm working on bettering my memory. maybe this is interesting to someone, idk. \n\ni'm really sorry for any bad grammar or writing, i am still very dysfunctional in my cognitive abilities.\n",

        "content": "feeling pretty hopeless after recent doctors appointment i, 20f, have been struggling with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and ocd since i was about 13. i started sertraline when i was 14 and am currently on 50mg\n\never since i was 16, i have developed some kind of sleep disorder, a mix between insomnia and hypersomnia. i can sleep for 30 hours +, and then have times where i can\u2019t sleep for three nights straight.\n\nmy doctor knows about this and has prescribed me amitriptyline to help me get to sleep, which works great, but when i\u2019m in a really bad fatigue stage, genuinely nothing can help. i cant get a job because of this, meaning i have no source of income. my parents are officially my caregivers and are given a small payment fro the government to look after me, but that\u2019s it.\n\nat my recent appointment, i went over these issues with her again. she said that medication is only half of the treatment, which is why i\u2019m not getting better, and i really need psychotherapy, mainly cbt. she says that my sleep issues are very likely connected to my mental health issues\n\ni completely see where she\u2019s coming from and i don\u2019t doubt her. this appointment has just left me so hopeless now. i cannot afford therapy. like at all. i was able to get free therapy when i was 16 and under but no cannot because i\u2019m no longer a minor. like i said earlier, i cannot get a job because of these issues, and my parents are only being paid a very small amount, it only covers my medication and some food.\n\ntherapy appointments here start at $100 an hour and there\u2019s no way i can afford that, it took us a month just to be able to afford a regular gp appointment. i\u2019m at a dead end, i fear there\u2019s nothing more i can do and that scares me. i\u2019ve been doing these stupid online surveys and stuff to try and earn some cash but it\u2019s only pocket change.\n\ni feel stupid because i know there\u2019s people out there that have it so much worse than me, it just sucks. my parents feel so guilty they can\u2019t help more, and i always tell them it\u2019s not their fault. i\u2019m so sorry for everyone else in a similar position too.\n\n",

(this is the only quote i\u2019m paraphrasing because i can\u2019t remember exactly what she said but something weird like that.) but isn\u2019t that a weird thing to say, especially when you consider how mentally unstable i was? my partner is really not happy about the fact that this happened, i also think it\u2019s weird but i\u2019ve got other stuff to deal with. but i was in such a poor mental condition and really freaked out by getting there when the lights were out and they wouldn\u2019t let me make a phone call. most memories from this experience feel too hard to comprehend, and it\u2019s not even necessarily the nurse\u2019s comments but being naked there feels burned in my brain along with the other memories and it feels like an emotion that\u2019s too hard to handle.",

        "content": "derealization and depersonalization hey there. i recently wrote a comment in response to a post that was deleted shortly after. here it is, slightly changed.\n\nwhether it is derealization or depersonalization, the distinction is rather intricate; both belong to dissociative disorder, which already is pretty much a spectrum. \n\nderealization is essentially loosing intimate familiarity with objects you know while still recognizing them intellectually. depersonalization is far more frightening, since it is basically the same thing, but it applies to your sense of self. perhaps, they originate from the same malfunction in your mind, read your physiology, but are distinct enough to be classified as different symptoms. i had both; now it\u2019s only - though not as intense, frequent and frightening as it used to be - depersonalization episodes.\n\nwhen a person, especially a child is routinely subjected to psychological trauma the brain learns how to protect itself from it by dissociating, but not just by making you somewhat inattentive to the harmful environment. that too, but something far more consequential is taking place, something that at some point reveals itself as a qualitative change in perception of objects or your self, or both, though not necessarily at the same time.\n\nvery few specialists can explain it with greater precision. and i am not even formally educated in this or any other field. all i have regarding this matter is decent understanding of a very difficult subject in philosophy called consciousness of self, learned online, from various resources. the philosopher who contributed the most to this subject is immanuel kant; the book that explained the most about it is critique of pure reason - a notoriously difficult read. the part of it where you can find the most of his presentation of the subject is infamous transcendental deduction of categories of pure understanding, a virtually impenetrable text. there, you can find his account of the origins of self, called transcendental unity of apperception. it is, at least doctrinally, reflected in modern neuroscience.\n\nif you want to learn a few things about self consciousness within the framework of speculative philosophy, it is going to be a long road. and ultimately, the destination is not even in sight. we simply do not know substantially more about what yields consciousness than philosophers of post enlightenment knew centuries ago.\n\nmy advice is, call a psychologist after a psychologist until you hear his competence in dissociative disorder. for the lack of anything better, refer to this post. don\u2019t buy any assurances that a person is an ace of every mental illness, normally found in his online profile, prior to the actual conversation with this professional.\n\nthis condition is not the most crippling of them all, but a very difficult thing to understand, for the reasons i already disclosed. you are not the only person to have it. however, different people are affected by it differently. being an early teenager, in the country where you simply do not talk about your mental issues and at the time when it was a bigger stigma than it is now, i was terrified by it. my short moments of depersonalization would be accompanied by commercial grade panic attacks. when it comes to discrete mental experiences, nothing is scarier than losing normal perception of your self.\n\ngood luck to you and many thanks to your supportive loved ones for their care for you, i know how hard it is for them to even try to understand you. \n\nbe well.",

        "content": "is it over for me? i have tried everything it seems like but the doors keep closing on me. a lack of friends for life? i don\u2019t think i can run from this issue no more, i am legit two decades old now. i should have this shit figured out about by now. why don\u2019t have a lot of friends? why does my social life seem so sad? \n\ni was in my first year of high school when the pandemic came. in junior high i had a good group of friend and felt good in myself. in high school our friend group got separated so half went one place and other somewhere else. i lost touch with the other members of the group after about 2 years. in high school i hung out with my friends from junior high (they are my best friends in my opinion now). but the pandemic hindered my ability to make more friends, ruined my progress. \n\nto be honest, i feel the pandemic fucked a lot up for me. i felt more anxious, family fighting, depression cause my grades were slipping and i was scared about getting into university, couldn\u2019t find a part time job. luckily, i got through that stuff without end it all. i live in a city where everyone attends uni where they did high school. so they live with friends or stay at home with family. i got into university thankfully and i\u2019m grateful to be living with my family at home. it makes me shitty for complaining, but on the other side i feel i like feeling lonely is worse than economic troubles at times. my family isn\u2019t rich by any means, barely middle class (maybe lower middle class now a days). being low income isn\u2019t as bad when you have a collective community to turn to. \n\ni feel like my two friends closest friends are now drifting away. i have tried to make new friends in uni and my major but they never last or go beyond surface area. i feel no one is really that interested in me. i have tried everything, even tried going to therapy (i did learn some things), but still no damn change. i have some class friends in my major and they are great people, honestly i would love to be friends outside of class. but they are a bit older than me and graduating this year. i look at myself as i will be graduating next year, why has these last three years been sorta bad in achieving my goal of making friends? \n\ni can\u2019t go to events or have fun during the breaks or holidays as i don\u2019t have a lot of friends. now that i\u2019m graduating next year, i feel if i start working or doing more education i feel like the loneliness is gonna feel even stronger. i have strict parents and eldest daughter of middle eastern immigrants so that does play a part in who i am friends with. i don\u2019t wanna be friends with someone who more about going out constantly and drinking, partying, etc. i am not a prude. \n\nalso tho i am not that religious or cultured to be friends with people like that. i fit in no where it feel like at times. \n\nwhat can i do?

        "content": "struggling with growth hi, my name is zay and im 18yrs old. im writing this because.. i have no clue what to do anymore. i\u2019m too poor for therapy and i don\u2019t fully trust my friends.. i feel like i have no one. i feel like i\u2019ve been stuck in the same cycle for years, and no matter what i do, i always end up back in the same place. i have a lot of issues i want to work on, but i don\u2019t even know where to start, and it feels like everything i do is just surface level change. i can never seem to take any accountability, only react afterwards with anger and self pity\u2026 its pathetic yes. i\u2019ve considered killing myself on my birthday for the last few years\u2026i never go through but i imagine scenarios of the reaction\u2014 but also writing some grand note. a big part of it comes from my childhood. i never had a father figure growing up he left before i was born and has a new family now. i try to ignore it, but it eats at me. i see the life he has with them, and i hate how jealous and angry i feel. growing up all i had was my grandfather and i love him.. but he\u2019s getting older i feel like he\u2019s slipping away when i need him most. my mom was emotionally manipulative and struggled with addiction when i was younger, and i spent time in foster care before living with my grandparents. and i do understand she had a hard childhood.. it mirrors eachother.. me and hers, my grandmother had an addiction problem and.. my spent alot of time in and out of prison.. on the streets. she\u2019s sober now, and i know i should let go of the resentment, but i feel like can\u2019t. even when i try, the feelings don\u2019t go away. i even have resentment towards her for the fact we\u2019re poor.. which isn\u2019t her fault. i just struggling ever month.. it\u2019s either food or the rent.. we don\u2019t even have a car right now. all of this has shaped the way i see myself, and it\u2019s not in a good way. i don\u2019t feel like a real man. i compare myself to other men constantly and always feel like i\u2019ll never measure up. i struggle with my emotions i either feel things too intensely, or i just go numb and shut down. i also have a habit of self-sabotage and being impulsive, especially when i feel like i\u2019m losing control. i say things i don\u2019t mean, i act in ways i regret, and then i get stuck in a cycle of guilt and self-hatred. i don\u2019t want to keep hurting myself or the people around me, but i don\u2019t know how to stop. i feel i\u2019ve never felt love and i can\u2019t even love myself.. i don\u2019t know what it feels like more, i don\u2019t even feel it towards my mother especially.. or my grandfather or my other family. i feel like my life is gonna be miserable.. like im stuck like this. where do i even start? how do you break out of cycles when they feel like all you\u2019ve ever known? please, if you have any advice.. i\u2019d appreciate it.\n",

        "content": "reading shitty texts between my parents 22f i happened to be looking through my mum's phone and i came across some old text messages between her and my dad which have just left me in tears. back last year, i was really struggling with my health and i was just very depressed and in pain every day. my dad had texted my mum that 'i dont know how to attract a man and that basically even when i try with my appearance, i have such low self-esteem that i don't get anywhere'. he went on to say that he thinks im a non-practising lesbian, i have no interest in men and bottom line, regardless of my sexuality, sex-related issues are the root cause of my issues i.e.: because i don't really socialise and date, i have issues. i dont know why this made me cry. maybe in part because my dad relegated my issues to my sexuality and i always saw my dad as a homophobe so even if i really wasn't a heterosexual, i can't even say this would be something i would want to discuss with my dad. i don't know if i'm a lesbian. i don't really experience attraction to women. admittedly i don't really experience attraction to men either. i find men attractive but i pull away easily when they do something i don't like. i think what bothers me is that my whole life i had to watch my parent's unhappy, abusive marriage fold out in childhood, abuse which my dad projected onto me as well. i feel like to categorise my issues to lesbianism just ignores all the bullshit i had to put up with as a child. sometimes i think i am so independent because i am scared of men and relationships. i don't know why i am so upset about this.",

        "content": "3 science-based hacks to improve your mental health (backed by neuroscience) here are three science-based hacks i use to improve my mental health, and i think it could help you too!   \n  \ni have researched some of the latest neuroscience research and have compiled below some powerful yet simple techniques to boost your mental well-being. \n\nhere are 3 of my favorite science-backed hacks that i found during my research.\n\n# 1. the \u201cbrain reset\u201d trick \u2013 control your nervous system with deep breathing\n\n**how it works:**\n\n* stress triggers the **sympathetic nervous system** (fight-or-flight mode), increasing anxiety and mental fatigue.\n* deep breathing **activates the parasympathetic nervous system**, shifting the body into a calm state.\n* studies show **slow exhalation reduces cortisol** (the stress hormone) within minutes.\n\n**how to do it (4-7-8 breathing method):**\n\n1. inhale deeply through your nose for **4 seconds**.\n2. hold your breath for **7 seconds**.\n3. exhale **slowly** through your mouth for **8 seconds**.\n4. repeat **3-5 times** for an instant calming effect.\n\n**why it works:** the long exhale signals to your brain that you're **safe**, helping to reduce anxiety **instantly**.\n\n# 2. the \"morning sunlight hack\" \u2013 boost mood & energy in 5 minutes\n\n**how it works:**\n\n* sunlight exposure in the **first hour of waking** increases **serotonin** (the happiness chemical) and **regulates circadian rhythms** for better sleep.\n* neuroscientists found **just 5-10 minutes of morning sunlight can lower depression symptoms** and improve focus.\n\n**how to do it:**\n\n* **go outside for 5-10 minutes** within an hour of waking (even if it's cloudy).\n* no sunglasses\u2014let natural light enter your eyes to trigger serotonin production.\n* if you can\u2019t go outside, use a **10,000-lux light therapy lamp** to mimic sunlight.\n\n**why it works:** morning light **stabilizes dopamine levels**, making you feel more **motivated and alert** throughout the day.\n\n# 3. the \u201c5-minute brain dump\u201d \u2013 reduce overthinking & mental overload\n\n**how it works:**\n\n* mental stress builds up because **your brain tries to hold onto too many thoughts at once**.\n* writing things down **frees up mental load** and reduces **rumination (overthinking loop)**.\n* studies show **journaling for just 5 minutes a day can reduce anxiety & improve emotional regulation**.\n\n**how to do it:**\n\n1. **set a 5-minute timer.**\n2. **write down everything on your mind**\u2014worries, stressors, thoughts (no filter).\n3. **look at your list** and ask:\n   * **what is in my control?** \u2192 create a small action step.\n   * **what is out of my control?** \u2192 let it go.\n\n**why it works:** getting thoughts **out of your head and onto paper** signals to the brain that it **doesn\u2019t need to keep obsessing** over them.\n\n# final thoughts\n\ni found that i didn't need big, overwhelming changes to improve my mental health! sometimes, small **science-backed tweaks** can make a huge impact! \n\ntry one of these today and let us know how you feel!\n\ndiscussion topics:\n\n**which one do you think will help you the most?**   \n**have you tried any of these before?**   \n  \n**let me know!**\n\npatrick f.",

        "content": "someone not taking my mh seriously i told someone who is in my class recently about the fact i struggle with my mental health (without going into detail about what i'm experiencing and have done in the past because i'm not comfortable with that). he seems to be totally convinced that i'm fine because i don't *seem* unwell to him. i have known this man for 7 months, seeing him <2 days a week on average. does he seriously think that he has any say whatsoever on the state of my mental wellbeing?\n\ni mask incredibly well, partly because i get so overwhelmed and depressed by life i end up in a state of silence where i'm simply trying not to break down crying. as an already quiet person, this would just seem like me being my usual self to others, perhaps just daydreaming.\n\ni also mentioned how everyone around me seems to believe i'm autistic, especially the autistic people. i'm interested in maybe seeking an assessment to see if that is the case. so, i mentioned this to him and he was adamant i can't be. i listed all the most stereotypical reasons i could think of as this is an older man who i presumed wouldn't have any idea about autism beyond the stereotypes. i mentioned things like can't make eye contact, trouble with food, sensory issues, struggling with people. nope. he literally said that's not what autism is like? what does he think autism is?? he said he knows someone who knows about autism. okay? he then mentioned how it's the \"trendy\" thing now. so? without people talking about it more i don't think i would've ever considered that maybe there's a reason i've always struggled with basic things everyone else seemed fine with. apparently me being able to talk to classmates means i must be allistic, as if autistic people can't talk to others or something? i honestly really struggle talking to others and always have. always been labelled as \"shy\". i'll often talk when spoken to, but i have auditory processing issues and can't even figure out what is being said half the time so sometimes that doesn't even work. i rarely start the conversations because they're not my close friends. other times i just really really feel overwhelmed and am limited to nods, shakes, shrugs, \"mhm\"s and awkward smiles. i try my best to hide the mental struggle i face every day while talking to people so of course i'll talk to them because i just wanna fit in. i've had bad experiences with people disliking me for pretty much just existing and talking behind my back. it's not fun having to go around pretending you don't know your friends hate you, just waiting until the day school ends so you don't have to speak to them again. i just wanna fit in.\n\nhe was also saying that anxiety and depression is normal because everybody experiences that sometimes. i definitely have experienced various degrees of these during my life, definitely more than what's considered normal. his advice to me was basically \"talk to people and you'll be happy\" ... having to talk to people i'm not super close with is the most mentally exhausting task imaginable to me. \n\nhim basically dismissing my mental health issues because i am not visibly displaying my mental state 24/7 has really upset me. i don't even know what to do about this. it's not like i have any sorta diagnoses to wave in his face. mental health support here is severely lacking and even if i did reach out for help i'd probably just be shoved on some infinitely long waiting list if taken seriously at all. this is why i don't open up to people about my mh.",

        "content": "5 years since covid hi, for context, i live in england, and was 13 when covid hit. it\u2019s 5 years to the day when our school was shut and lockdown was announced. this is my diary entry i wrote earlier, it was more of a vent than anything.\n\nit\u2019s been 5 years since the announcement of lockdown by boris johnson. i remember that dark grey wednesday p5 science with miss stanley (not her real name) when she told us that school would be shut for two weeks. we all believed it would be 2 weeks. never, i believe, out of all the many wrongs in my life, have i been more wrong. these 5 years of chaos, terror, isolation and difficulty have, and will continue to dictate (hopefully to a lesser degree) the future course of my life. i wonder who i would be and what position i would be in otherwise. covid\u2019s left its scars already, and given the continuing pressures (leaving school, exams, family life etc), im far from out the woods yet. i\u2019ve become a much harsher, sometimes somewhat duller figure since then - my eyes themselves look physically tired, even after a good nights sleep. i\u2019ve been depressed and in therapy, navigated horrible mood swings, loneliness and reclusion and from 23-24 a really shitty job. everything politically, seems worse and looking at that the future seems bleaker than ever. yet i must hope, and indeed must be the hope i strive for. been stuck for 5 years in this shit. grandads gone, charlie (not his real name) too. i\u2019ve handled their deaths, and i\u2019ve become even more balanced, productive, and at times happier than ever in the last year or so. but there\u2019s a lot of times of hopelessness and it doesn\u2019t feel quite as bright as it used to. i suppose that\u2019s growing up. i\u2019ve struggled with faith (i am currently atheist), eating too much, and masturbation. sometimes, if i relapse, i feel farther away than ever from my goals. my physical scars, although i have gained a few, are little compared to the state of has left my mind on. i\u2019ve missed important lessons and moments, which hasn\u2019t helped. it\u2019s been 5 years of decline, 5 years of shit with little to show for it save shattered dreams, fraying relationships and a greying psyche. and sitting here now, having just resisted the urge of starting smoking, little has really changed. i may look better, have good nights out with friends and even be more stabilising than i was, but the sun just isn\u2019t as bright, nor the future, nor the music as loud and the happiness as intense. when i have happy times, i never feel quite as \u2018present\u2019 as before. i\u2019ve tried and tried and tried, and been knocked down time and again. i have become more resilient and patient thanks to this, and 24/25 i\u2019ve been more productive, and probably at some times, happier than ever. but despite all my victories, it feels as if what i\u2019m striving for, no longer exists. the future days will be long (exams etc) but i must keep finding new purpose despite everything. i can sense, despite the ups and downs, a slow healing, but part of me will never be the same.",

        "content": "i feel like i am losing brain function, because of screen addiction? hidden depression? anyone else experienced this? i was a bright kid growing up, did well in school and participated in all sorts of extra curriculars. but my home life was really sad, i felt constantly neglected by my parents who constantly obsessed over my younger brother (the golden child).\n\nas i grew up it only got worse, by the time i was in high school, i was verbally abused pretty much everyday and physically abused now and then. \n\ni think my spark just fizzled out more and more as i grew up.. to the point that now, i am in college and i have no friends. i don't participate in any of the things that i used to be good at. i have no motivation to do things like exercising, socializing, reading or even studying. i don't remember shit that i study anyways.\n\nwhat is scaring me the most is the fact that i used to be sharp though. studying was so easy till idk 10th grade. i would do really well in school with little to no efforts. \n\nand now it's difficult. i don't remember anything. i don't even remember other stuff either like chores. i barely notice people walking by, i don't remember faces and i feel like i have become really dumb. like i have become a completely blunt blade. i can't make jokes, i can't think of what to say in conversations, i don't shower for days at an end, i don't feel like doing anything... all i do is scroll on my phone, all day long. \n\ni have no motivation to do well because i don't think i can. \n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "cannot seem to accept life hurts in so many ways and there\u2019s nothing to do about it i have several mental and physical illnesses. for many years i suffered mentally and it has left its scars on me psychologically. but over time i accepted my life for what it had become, what i could do and couldn\u2019t do. my mental health became stable and i somewhat found myself again. then the physical illnesses came. and they keep coming. all the time. when i just start thinking \u201ci\u2019ve got this figured out now,\u201d and try and accept a new kind of living, i end up with a load of new hardships in form of sickness in various forms.\n\nit\u2019s like i am constantly being tested. i have always hated the saying \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u201d i have never become stronger from any of my demons and battles. i have only been left more and more thinly spread out, weaker and less stable. i\u2019m not a negative or pessimistic person, but i am a realist. i\u2019m not weaker because of a bad mindset, i\u2019m weaker because i am truly damaged and i am given no breaks. \n\ni can fewer and fewer things. i am so burn out. i want quality of life, at least just a little stability. this last year i\u2019ve thought many times of giving up, and by that i do not mean suicide. just stop fighting for better qol, stop trying to get better physically, not bothering with anything. rot away the rest of my life. the thought of it feels easier than how i\u2019m living now. fighting so far has rewarded me with very little, life just keeps punishing me. i have not had a single week in 12 years without some kind of larger issue. issues that take away independence.\n\npain, surgery, losing close ones, insomnia, colds, flue, autoimmune diseases flaring, new diseases popping up, organs failing, actually being a burden rather than only feeling like one. not being able to take care of my basic needs. it\u2019s so fucking humiliating. \n\nlike i said, i am a realist and i have never asked for much. i\u2019m fair to myself and others. i know life will hurt. no one goes about life without any issues. i don\u2019t feel sorry for myself, i am just hurting so much from always hurting. i\u2019m tired of being tired. wanting to live instead of surviving, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unfair standard. we all have periods of time in life where we survive instead of living, that is life, but doing it for 12 years. i feel used up. the endless motivation and drive i\u2019ve had all my life seems completely drained.\n\nlike i said, i don\u2019t pity myself, i\u2019m just very aware of my hurt and shortcomings. aware of what i\u2019ve lost and what will never be. realities that are easier to accept than to live in, but still difficult to accept.\n\ni escape a lot. maladaptive daydreaming has become my saviour and i can imagine myself into a different world 12 hours a day. what kind of life is that? certainly not the one i hoped or fought for. but it\u2019s the only place where i feel serene, where it doesn\u2019t hurt as much. it\u2019s a place where i have some sense of control. \n\ni have done all the therapies, mental and physical, and all have reached a wall saying there\u2019s nothing more for them to do. i just have to accept continuous suffering and hurt, more than most people go through, without a break. \n\nthat itself hurts. the pain of realising that, it\u2019s so painful. i feel dread, like my insides being shredded by a grater. \n\nit fucking hurts.",

(its our favorite show and that's my comfort show tbh) i put it on and lay down on the couch. i couldn't pay attention to the show, i was trying to keep my body still. i got up to grab a weight blanket. laid back down and things kept getting worse. \n\ni jumped up off the couch, my body just did that on its own and my friend asked if i was okay. i told her yes and that i just can't sit still for some reason. \n\ni go into her kitchen to pace back and fourth because that's what my body felt like doing. breathing was getting harder. i remember grabbing my chest. at this point everything started to hurt. all my muscles were so tight, i could feel my heart racing. my heart rate was 150-170 bpm. i was so aware of everything in my body. \n\nmy friend kept asking me if i was okay and i told her that i'm okay and i kept apologizing because i knew i was scaring her. i told her i think i'm having a panic attack. my memory gets fuzzy around here.\n\ni remember that i couldn't breathe, i was gasping for air and my hearing sounded muffled, my body couldnt keep a temp. it kept changing from sweaty to chills. i was shaking and trembling, i had a killer headache and felt like i was going to pass out, everything felt numb but also painful?. i remember being in so much physical pain that i started crying. that freaked my friend out more because i'm not a person who cries a lot. \ni remember calling out for my mom because i just really wanted a hug from her. \n\ni remember going outside (embarrassingly i was still begging for my mom) but i was outside since  the cold can help ground a person. i picked up snow and just held it. at this point i barely could breath and i remember dialing 911 but i didn't actually call them. i almost did though. i remember ending up on the ground just gasping for air. i get back inside and ended up throwing up (thankfully in the washroom and not randomly on the ground) and the worst of my panic attack ended there. \ni know i'm missing information here but honestly the worst part of it is all a blank. \n\nthe other 3 panic attacks weren't that bad, but still bad enough. i just don't know how to ground myself. like it's not my mind that needs grounding, it's my body. my mind knows that i'm fine and that i'm okay. it's my body that i can't control.",

        "content": "how could i do more? 22m (me), 21f (partner) \u2013 we\u2019ve been in a relationship since late 2023. both of us are autistic, but i\u2019m higher-functioning. when we first met, she seemed independent, but she has a mild hoarding issue and is emotionally fragile. she grew up with parents who didn\u2019t support her special needs and even refused to acknowledge her autism. her teeth are in bad condition because her mom didn\u2019t want to fix them. she left home at 18 and moved to our state\u2019s metro area.\n\nbefore i met her, she had been fired from her first job and didn\u2019t understand unemployment. she applied for it but ended up owing money. i met her shortly after this incident, and she isolated herself, staying in her apartment for months. we started dating around this time (we met at a job we both had). things seemed fine when we didn\u2019t live together, but she was always financially unstable and relied on her family for help. i didn\u2019t know this and assumed she could pay her bills.\n\nfast forward a year \u2013 i got into some trouble and stayed with her to get back on my feet. she adopted her first cat, who had brain trauma and urinated inappropriately. she didn\u2019t have the mental capacity to deal with it, and it became overwhelming. this added stress to our relationship. my underwear, especially, would often be drenched in cat urine. the cat would also pee on the bed, and she enabled him, even though she hated it. i thought it would be a good idea for us to get a place together, but it was a mistake.\n\nwe found an apartment, and things went downhill. i don\u2019t blame her for the property management\u2019s mistake, but they charged us for 3 months of rent because we held the place for a month. we agreed to pay half, thinking it was only 2 months. when it came time to move in, she had only a couple hundred to her name and had hoarded more comfort items. i maxed out my credit cards and borrowed money from my dad to cover everything. i paid him back, but i should have seen it as a sign to walk away. i moved everything, which hurt my back, and after it was done, we were done.\n\na few months later, the cat\u2019s behavior worsened. he would urinate on me, on the bed, on the floor, and even poop on the couch. we tried everything \u2013 different litters, 10 litter boxes, medication \u2013 but it didn\u2019t work. one night, stressed from work, finances, and the cat, i threw the cat (not hard) into the bathroom and had a complete meltdown. i feel terrible about it to this day.\n\ni should also mention that she\u2019s been put on suicide watch multiple times and often shuts down. she tried to get her cna but failed. she thought the hospital would offer her a lower-level position, but after 2 months of hearing nothing, she didn\u2019t say anything to me. i only found out when her half of the rent was due. i had to work every day that month to cover it. she ended up working at mcdonald's for barely 20 hours a week. her friend drives her, but now rent is barely getting paid, and she continues to shut down.\n\nafter everything we\u2019ve been through, i\u2019ve concluded that once our lease is up, i won\u2019t continue the relationship. she\u2019s too stubborn to get the help she needs. i\u2019m afraid she might take her life after i leave because the pressures of adulting are too much for her. she finds it shameful to live in a group home, but i feel like i have to accept that this might happen, and i can\u2019t control what happens after we break up.\n\ni need to understand how to best help her manage this transition, knowing i won\u2019t be around after the lease ends.",

(the situation is obviously complicated, but i don't want to waste peoples time explaining) \n\nabout 2.5 weeks ago he almost attempted suicide, i had to call the cops to stop him and send him to a hospital. that experience was horrific for the both of us. the hospital they sent him to was not equip to handle these types of cases and it made things so much worse. since then, he tells me every day that he wants to kill himself and doesn't want to be here anymore and so on while also refusing treatment and help of any kind. i still love him and try to be there for him in every way i can, and while he wants me in his life (like friends just not dating) he is only seemingly getting worse. not to mention this constant expression of wanting to die while i understand just how difficult what he is going through is, it is wearing me down, and i constantly feel like i am about to lose it.\n\nwhat am i to do? how am i supposed to recover with this endless cycle continuing? i am honestly not even angry at him; i have forgiven him and i am trying to heal myself. i just truly can't seem to handle him always obsessing about death and such, as it is very sensitive to me from past experiences. i understand that i have done a lot, and whatever choice he makes is not my fault, but i want to help because i love and care about him. what should i do?",

(especially recently) in my head we share similar physical traits but i don't see myself as her. would something like that be considered as self harm or am i once again over thinking it?",

        "content": "how to handle the mental toll? i couldn't put more than one flag warning so here: suicide attempts, self-harm, violence, addiction, and need help/support\n\ni (m14) have apparently been through some stuff. from ages 2-7 or so my dad would sometimes hit me or my brother (who is 3 years older than me) for being some form of disrespectful to an adult family member.beforw he got his anger in check. and hasn't done anytbing close to aggressive with anyone in the family since. i think but, can't be for sure if this is the reason my brother what he did. i think he felt very belittled by being treated like this and wanted a way to show his dominance or something. so he would sexually abuse me. he did this from when i was 6 or 7 - 9. i told the most trusted adult i knew that wasn't in my immediate family but i saw her regularly. and she didn't believe me. also during this time when i was at my best friend's house down the street. when i went inside and was all alone with my best friend (my age), his older brother (2 years older), and the oldest brother (4 years older), i was bound to a chair and sexually abused then, and i stupidly went back because i was used to it with my brother.  i only went over there again to play basketball with him. and sometime after the incident at my best friend's house, i was having a sleepover with a friend from school. his older brother had a friend who had been drinking and was hammered. so he called up my friend's brother and asked to be picked up and crash in their spare bedroom. which he did. around 2 am or so, when i was going to the washroom, he pulled me outside to the balcony to give me some \"life advice\" which ended in him not having an ashtray for his cigarettes and using my legs, instead. i still have some level of \"ptsd\" from it. i can't here a bic style lighter flick without thinking of that night. after a little bit i was completely emotionally numb. and couldn't feel anything, but still kept trying to be the happy little kid my family knew( which is still going on today). whilst at night i would take the stick from the dollar store suckered i got, light them on fire with the bbq lighter and added to the burn marks on my legs so i could feel something (which i've been 3 years without self-harm, on a positive note). i've attempted to end it 6 times. been okay on that front recently. but i still have such severe depression, and still feel numb. i've got into linkin park and other nu-metal bands because it helps me deal with some of the stuff. my family hates it tho. sports seem to take my mind off stuff too. sadly i also resorted and got addicted to 18+ content. it has been an escape for me but im really trying to quit. all of it's been taking such a mental toll on me. especially after a 3 year \"situationship\" with a girl who went for a different guy afterward and lied about it and downplayed everything \"for me\". my church youth group leader went through depression,  18+ addictions, and suicidal times as well and has been helping me. but just want to hear your advice as well.

(people dont believe me when i told that im 26) i think nobody take me seriously, i hate that, i hate this part of me but i cant help but doing that. (im joking a lot but i still do my job the best i can and in a serious way)\n\ni really like working there, but when im no i feel like i have no life\u2026 during week end i just want to go back to work, i sleep a lot (i watch tv shows, read books, play video games but every we are the same). i stay at home all the time (thanks i have my parents but without them will be the same). i cant go out even for a walk because if i have no good reason that forced me to go out (like i have a aim so thats not weird i go out). i dont see myself in the future and im afraid of it. i never had a boyfriend, feel like im not able to live alone, feel like i wont be able to have a job\u2026\n\ni was thinking about doing a phd next year (well, if someone accept me) and if not im thinking of suicide but dont want my parents going throught that\u2026 also im afraid because i dont want to start a phd and then suicide in the middle of it. would be a waste for supervisors\u2026.\n\ni feel really alone\u2026 does someone feel like this ?\nand feel like this text is a bit disjointed\u2026 hopefully someone will understand\u2026",

        "content": "how to help a loved one with depression? my boyfriend has been depressed for several years and the smoking makes it worse. i think so, because the more he smokes, the worse his depression got.\nhe doesn't want to work and finish university because it takes away from what he really wants to do - travel, read, do business.\nhe quit his job and i did his university work for him and he had a lot of time, which he ended up smoking. he doesn't think that his depression is because of the smoking, but when he does it he just sleeps and doesn't have the energy to do anything else, i try to cook healthy meals, help with chores, show love and support, but it doesn't help at all. i'm starting to feel like i'm a bad partner because i can't help him in any way, but i want him to get better. he doesn't want to go to a psychologist, he doesn't want to talk and he doesn't want to do anything about it, because the whole world is capitalist and you have to spend time working and he can't change that. sometimes when he tries to quit smoking, he thinks it would be better to not live. i know that you can only help a person if they want it, but how do you help a person understand that they need help?\n\n",

        "content": "dropping out, how to minimize impending downward spiral? context: 30f, severe/persistent/treatment-resistant mental illness since middle school. adhd, depression, social anxiety, ocd, and a complex trauma history. i never learned to drive and live in a rural area without public transport so i'm basically housebound. i've been in therapy and taking different medication for most of my life but those clearly haven't made a dent. i live by myself on disability benefits and have no friends or family or support system outside of my therapist. i dont remember the last time i felt a hug or went somewhere for fun.\n\nlooking back, it was a pretty short-sighted decision but last fall, i started taking some online classes for a 3-semester certification program in medical coding because it seemed like a decent fit for me and i'd like to one day provide for myself and maybe even have an income above the poverty line. first semester went well and then like three weeks into the second one, it became apparent that this is just too hard for me and i'm not going to be able to continue with the program.\n\nmy therapist says i shouldn't look at this as an abject failure but more as something i tried that turned out not being right for me. i'm not sure if that's supposed to be comforting. at this point, after all the little pursuits and aims and hobbies and education goals i've tried out, i have to wonder if *anything* is right for me. maybe i'm better off just focusing on housework and trying to look after myself. (not that those have historically gone well either though lol)\n\n\"college drop-out\" probably isn't the right term since it's not like i was going for an actual degree program, but it's close enough and gets the overall point across. another negative label was the last thing i needed, but here we are. \n\ni'm not sure what comes next, i'd just like to avoid tailspinning so hard i end up inpatient again. i regret even trying.\n\nthank you for reading. just typing it all out is helping me get through the night at least.",

        "content": "why is nothing changing? i'm falling apart and, despite doing everything in my power to fix things, it feels like my life is just collapsing. i'm 18m and a senior in hs (not held back, started school a year later than normal). i have adhd, misophonia, anxiety, and depression, the last three of which have been around for a while.  \nall of these are medicated. in fact, up until a few weeks ago, i was functioning great at school. i fell behind often due to the adhd, but i always caught back up in the end. up to this point i've been a straight-a student and gotten a 35 on the act.\n\nbut recently everything just sorta collapsed. four weeks ago i started taking ssri medications for the anxiety and depression. this was in addition to my adhd meds. two weeks ago, i had a panic attack so bad i thought i was dying and was rushed to the er. since then i've not been able to even look at my schoolwork.  \nit's not just an \"oh it's boring\" or \"oh it feels scary\". every time i try to concentrate on schoolwork, or anything even slightly related to schoolwork, in any way shape or form, i get a feeling of panic that erases my entire train of thought. my brain bounces right off the topic no matter how hard i try to force myself to pay attention.\n\nnow my grades are dropping, and it feels like my entire future is slipping away. being smart was all i had, and i had an amazing future laid out for myself. if i can't pull everything together in these last few weeks of school, that future is gone for good. colleges will retract their offers, and i'll be stuck in a job i hate myself for. being stuck in a labor job while knowing i had the chance to do so much more, knowing that i let my one chance to really contribute die in a ditch. the shame of it would break me, and i know for certain i would just give up at that point. and yet facing the death of my future, i still just can't pull things together.\n\nmy emotions are so strong and yet i don't feel them because of my medications. sometimes i randomly start crying or feel amazing for no reason at all. my brain focuses on random things, but never on what i actually need to focus on. i have friends, but i haven't talked to them in months. i'm trying to do mindfulness techniques, but they don't help. i'm going to therapy, but it isn't helping. the er doctors gave me medications to deal with breakthrough anxiety, but it doesn't help. my adhd medications stopped helping when i had the panic attack. the anxiety medications stopped helping for a while with the panic attack, then started helping, then stopped helping again.\n\nmy parents are supportive and are both frantically trying to help me through this, but neither of their efforts are doing anything. the more i try the more hopeless i feel and the worse my mental state gets. i don't want to give up, but i just don't know what to do anymore. i feel like i've run out of solutions.\n\nedits: minor corrections and wording changes",

(i will say a lot of this started after election)\n- been asked to leave many places\n\ni guess my question what can one do for someone like this?  i know that booze is a big part of this but it\u2019s medicating the mental illness.   there are a group of friends that want to help but do not know what to do.  i know that it\u2019s likely jail or worse if he does not seek help.  at this point we all hope he gets arrested just to clear the booze out and maybe get some type of help with the mental.  \n",

        "content": "my cousin needs help and idk what to do. hi. i got a question for anybody that may have gone through this. my cousin 30f has what i assume to be schizophrenia and potentially bipolar i don't know. she has been diagnosed with bipolar in the past. however the last few years it's gotten much worse with paranoia and voices. she believes things, symbols and people are out together. talks and codes and symbology. she doesn't make much sense and believes things that just aren't true.\n\nnow i've been in and out of drug addiction. i've had psychosis so i have an understanding of what she may or may not be going through. i also have had depression and anxiety. so i sort of understand but not fully. anyways she has also had drug addiction mostly crack and potentially heroin/fentanyl recently. she's always dabbled but it was mostly weed and maybe like molly here and there psychedelics. she mostly held her stuff together. held a job, had friends and a place to live. out of anyone in the family i thought she was really going to make it. oh and she had also been in and out of the psych ward before from like mental breakdowns. she had some issues but everyone does. \n\ni would say a few years ago maybe three. you really just kind of went off and deep end and gave up and started really getting into drugs. she lost everything her car apartment. she has been either homeless or couch surfing ever since. she is also been in and out of the psych ward. she's probably been 25 times. i mean it's so bad people just call on her cuz she just makes the scene or she's so out of it everywhere she goes. she is always been loud, argumentative, expressive. she goes in call us to come get her out which we don't. she won't accept that something's wrong with her she believes she's fine and it's everybody else. she won't take the medication or continue treatment afterwards. it's just a continued cycle of in and out. homelessness, begging my grandfather for money and a place to live which he doesn't do. the other day she came over and she just looked absolutely horrible i've never seen her look this bad. i'm worried about her i don't know if people are taking advantage of her or if she wants to live like this and do what she's doing. i don't think she knows what she's doing honestly. anyway i was just wondering if there was anything i could do to help her or get her into treatment where she wouldn't be able to leave right away. does anyone have any advice on what to do. a lot of people say tough love with drug addiction but this is serious mental illness as well she's in danger i mean even more than doing drugs because she's so far gone. she's staying with some guy and i feel like if he really cared he would either put her out so she would get herself back in the psych ward or he would make her go seek either impatient or outpatient treatment to stay with him. all right this is going on long enough like i said any help would be nice. thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "new wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement we've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. this undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \n\nwe've created a wiki that covers these issues.  we hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  it explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you're 100% committed, i'll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. the full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement). \n\nwe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our ops, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \n\nplease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsuicidewatch) with a link. we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. if you get a pm that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. \n\nthanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \n    \n    \n\n******\n***[/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement)***  \n*******\n\n###summary###\n\n**it's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. it's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. there are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \n\n###validate feelings and experiences, not self-destructive intentions###\n\nwe're here to offer support, not judgement.  that means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  the most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \n\nbut there's an important line to draw here.  there's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **it's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**\n\nanything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. it isn't supportive and does not help. it also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \n\ndo not treat any op's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \n\nin [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \n\n**so, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"i hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \n\n###how to avoid validating suicidal intent###\n\nkeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \n\n* **people who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). in particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it's not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"i don't understand what you're going through and i'm not going to try\".  people who've had \"help\" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  it doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   \n\n*  **most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  it's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. but preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \n\n* ***an unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  we don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. it's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  for every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. this can depend on many personal and situational factors. but when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  we go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this psa post](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \n\n* **there are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\n\nto avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\n\n###look out for deliberate incitement.  it may come in disguise.###\n\noften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_francis_melchert-dinkel)). people like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \n\nthey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  specifically you might see people doing the following:\n\n* encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **there are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\n\n* creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \n\nmany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  a couple of key points to keep in mind: \n\n* **skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"don't do it!\"), cheerleading (\"you've got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!\").  anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)\n\n* **choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our hotlines faq post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). the goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. we know that no individual or system is perfect.  mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \n\nplease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsuicidewatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. we don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",

        "content": "i\u2019ve had passive suicidal thoughts everyday for yrs now my whole story is way too fucking long for one single reddit post so i\u2019ll try my best to explain my situation while still keeping it short. \n\ni\u2019m 23f, i\u2019ve been depressed at least since i was 9yrs old but most likely even before that time. i\u2019ve dealt with my depression, anxiety and cptsd for yrs in therapy. i used to be much more suicidal and would self-harm a lot too, it was always very controlled \u201csafe\u201d self-harm but still harm nonetheless. \nlife hasn\u2019t been easy, but when is it easy for anyone, i\u2019ve always felt lost and alone even when surrounded by people that love me(sometimes it was worse when surrounded by people tbh). i\u2019m currently unemployed, financially dependent on my siblings (both parents are dead) and living with my closest and only friends which isn\u2019t going the best (not horrible just not the best). i\u2019ve also recently kinda lost friends that i\u2019ve known for 5yrs, they are alive but we had a falling out that was 2yrs incoming. \n\nexcept those things i\u2019m really not in the worst situation of my life, sure i\u2019m unemployed and feeling unbelievably lost in life, but i\u2019ve been in much worse shape before and i\u2019ve had some reaaaaaallly shitty things happen to me and around me before. \nso i feel stupid for feeling this way. my therapist (oh ya also i\u2019ve been in therapy on and off again for yrs and currently back on it for 6months now) has told me many times that you can\u2019t control how you feel so why would it be stupid. which i do agree that logically it\u2019s not stupid and i know that everything i\u2019ve just said are part of the reason for these thoughts. but i\u2019m just so sick of them, of myself, of living, of struggling in the world we all live in, of breathing, eating, sleeping, etc etc you get the idea. \n\ni\u2019m not genuinely suicidal, i don\u2019t have a plan and every time i think about dying i know i don\u2019t want to die. i don\u2019t want to hurt my family, my friends or my two lovely cats that i adore. \nbut\u2026. everyday every single day i can\u2019t help but think \u201ci wanna die\u201d, \u201ci wish a car would hit me while crossing\u201d, \u201ci wish i didn\u2019t wake up\u201d, \u201ci wish i could just stop it all and have some peace\u201d stuff like that. \ni feel guilty and shameful every time i think like that, bc again i don\u2019t want to hurt my loved ones. i\u2019ve seen and experienced what death, especially more sudden death, does to families and friends and god the pets and kids, the poor animals and kids that get fucked over bc no one ever wants to take them in. \n\ni wish i could stop feeling this way and having these passive suicidal thoughts, but i can\u2019t. and after more than a decade of this i fear it will really never stop, or at least it won\u2019t stop for idk how many more decades. \n\nis this what living is for most or just a good chunk of humanity? are we all just so fucked over by the world and other humans that we are born suffering and die suffering? are we all just built for pain, and that\u2019s why our brains remember bad and painful things much more than good happy things? if you aren\u2019t born a cis neurotypical white at least semi attractive and non poor man, does that make you destined to struggle? and is there really nothing i can do to escape the feeling of doom my whole generation feels for the way the world is turning? why do people hate so much, we are all hurting one way or another. please can i not just make it all stop suffocating me without having to die? \n\ni\u2019m scared and so goddam drained, even in my sleep i feel drained and i\u2019m not even one of the many people out there that have a job or jobs they hate bc they need to to live. i had two jobs and quit bc i thought that was what was killing me inside but nope, sure they were making it harder to survive by taking all my energy, but leaving those jobs didn\u2019t change all the much. just gave me a bit more energy to actually try to take care of myself. at least i\u2019m lucky to have siblings that can help me for a couple of months to try and find a way for me to live. and still i\u2019m drained, even on the days i do nothing but cuddle my cats and relax i still end up drained and sad. \n\non the good days, on the bad days even on the not bad or good days. i wish i could give up. \n\ni know this was all^ a lot and i certainly didn\u2019t keep it short. and if no one reads this or responds i\u2019m not going to off myself. this is an anonymous rant, since telling people irl always just makes me feel worse, like i\u2019m ruining their day by just telling them how i\u2019m feeling. i also know that these feelings and thoughts are big ass red flags and warning signs (why i\u2019m back in therapy). i know what they mean and i\u2019m trying my best to prevent the bad end result. but idk if i can. the most i\u2019ve been able to do in my short 23yrs of life is delay and give myself a couple good months sometimes if i\u2019m lucky. but it feels like for every good day i have i get 20 bad ones. and like i said before even on good days i still have at least one suicidal thought and want. \n\nit feels like a piece of me dies everyday and the saudade (portuguese word that is basically the feeling of missing something or someone), the shame, the disappointment, the grief, the depression, the anxiety, the stress, the uncertainty, the fact that i don\u2019t know what stability feels like. all that and more is just eating away at everything else, slowly consuming me until there are no more nice, good or even neutral feelings left. until i\u2019m nothing but a sack of flesh and bones oozing out bad vibes hahaha. \n\nanyways thank you if you have read this all and or commented. i haven\u2019t given up, but i do fear that it\u2019s just a matter of time\u2026..",

        "content": "running away i\u2019ve always had the thought that if life gets so bad, why commit suicide? why not just run away and start afresh? i now realise it\u2019s not as easy as that. a story that has always stuck in my head is of a young british man that ran away to thailand and told his family he met some bad people, was in trouble, and would never contact them again. he later got caught by the police working as a diving instructor, not in any danger. the way he left his family; wondering if he was safe or not; is a horrible thing to do, but maybe he felt it was the only way he could escape and survive? so, i won\u2019t judge but respect his motivation for trying to create a new life and acting upon it. \u00a0(if i edit this later, i will add a news article)\n\nas an adult, i now know it\u2019s not as easy as just running away and starting afresh. you need motivation and most of all money. none of which i have. you probably need more than that; to make yourself untraceable; it\u2019s almost impossible without the resources.\n\nat the end of the day what is the point in running away if i can\u2019t change my mental outlook and lived experience? the same \u201cshit\u201d feeling will follow me everywhere and anywhere. i believe everyone is born identical (mentally) and our lived experience effects the way we think and process data in the brain (i\u2019m in no way qualified to say this but it is what i guess).\n\ni can\u2019t pinpoint one exact experience that would potentially make me feel this way although i can very vividly pinpoint small things that have affected me. am i contradicting myself now? maybe. i don\u2019t know. is there any research looking into how one situation may affect a person but not another? are we really \u201cwired\u201d differently?\n\nfor example, i have had trouble with eye contact for a long time. am i doing it too much, or not enough? i didn\u2019t realise until i was talking to a therapist, and she asked if anyone ever said anything to me about my eye contact. i got a kind of \u201cflashback\u201d to when i was a young teenager and remembered the exact place, what i was doing and this person saying, \u201cwhy do you make so much eye contact\u201d. i do believe this one interaction has affected my daily life. if someone said something like that to me now, i don\u2019t think it would affect me. but at the time when i was a teenager, i probably would have thought the same, it won\u2019t affect me. but the truth is it did. so how do i know something like that won\u2019t affect me again now? maybe my brain has developed more? maybe i\u2019ve simply just grown up? or maybe i can be affected now just the same. i don\u2019t know.\n\nthere are other examples i can think of. like a girl saying i looked like a rat. i went home, looked in the mirror and agreed. i have a pointy nose and understand where she was coming from. it\u2019s weird i remember that though because it was only one time but it has stuck in my mind for years. there's a few; very few; examples like that i can think of.\n\ni\u2019m not sure if therapy wants me to blame my thoughts on these experiences or just provide a reason why. or something else?\n\nthis post was originally just me writing down my thoughts to try and distract myself from suicidal/upsetting thoughts. it has worked. but why not turn it into a reddit post. i\u2019m not sure of an appropriate title because the original topic has changed. but for simplicity to myself i\u2019ll keep the original title.\n\nthanks for listening.\n\nharry",

have you gone through this and felt you get closer in the next attempt? my other option is to call the help line and then probably idk... idk if it's in me the effort i have to put in or if i will just wake up and keep ignoring things and try to convince myself that with entertainment i can have enough distraction... but i don't want to keep hurting the people i care about and i don't want to hurt if i just can't be around them just being there for them... is the only thing that kept me alive but noticing what i've been doing and feeling the hopelessness of improvment i really think the only solution is to just die. and i'm calm, i'm breathing the rope around my neck feels comfortable but it is still the only reasonable thing i can think of, and idk why i can't bring myself to go through with it fully the most hypocritical thing is that i see post of others here and i want to say \"don't do it, stay, keep trying, don't die\" and in here waiting for my procrastination to end so i can see if i hang myself a little longer... i don't even know why i'm procrastinating it maybe i think is gonna fail and i don't want to go through with the other option... fuck... there's thoughts in my mind right now i want to share with specific people but i know their reaction would be disgust or they will just not care and it won't change anything they're just dumb thoughts about irony or idk... i want to stop carying i want to let go",

(even though she has two amazing parents who have given her the world and love her so much) meanwhile my mom killed herself when i was 18 and my dad doesn't give a shit about me and barely speaks to me, and i actually do believe he doesn't care at all if i die.\n\nso i said, fine, i wont mention it to anyone again. and her words very well may push forward when i decide to end my life, and i won't say a word to anyone about it. and i said oh and for years my mom said she wanted to kill herself, she would tell me almost daily for years she was going to do it, and yes she was scared. so my ex girlfriends information is incorrect. suicidal people usually tell other people multiple times they want to do it. am i wrong? but she's right about how no one cares. no one cares until your dead, sadly. in far too many cases. although some people have loving family's with people who do care. but i don't...must be nice. \n\n\n\n",

        "content": "i just need someone to hear this just over it\n\nfrustrated at life and feel under appreciated\n\nthis may be long, not sure. i just desperately need to vent everything that\u2019s wrong with me and my life. every night i basically just stay up late every night cry and pop zyns over and over to cope and it\u2019s killing me.\n\nfirst of all, i have crippling anxiety i\u2019m just very good at hiding it. it controls most things in my life yet i just fight through it and struggle on anyways. which is how i was able to become the president of a very large student organization at my university. this organization has lots of long standing traditions and a good reputation being able to lead it has been great. i even broke many records as the president. despite all of this, i\u2019m horrible depressed and anxious. i don\u2019t get any enjoyment out of life, every day is the same and forgetful, even when hanging with my friends. i\u2019m an average student and i\u2019m just burnt out on all of it.\n\nthe president last year of the club, everyone loved him and they even still come to him for advice in the club over me despite my own accomplishments. i feel so under appreciated and even disrespected at times and it just hurts. i haven\u2019t achieved much in life and this is the only thing i have. \n\ni\u2019m actually roommates with last years president and his girlfriend. he\u2019s my mentor in life and helped me immensely getting elected. he\u2019s a great guy and i can really go to him for everyone thing. there\u2019s just another thing, him and his girlfriend fight constantly. most of the time he starts them because he\u2019s sort of a narcissist and can never admit he\u2019s wrong or he\u2019ll get upset at her over extremely stupid things. at the beginning of the school year he basically drove her so insane she was going to commit suicide. he was at work so her parents reached out to me and told me the situation and where she was at. if i hadn\u2019t shown up that day she would have gone through with it. the relationship is extremely toxic, she\u2019s such a nice girl and he just treats her like dirt. they go through this cycle of going through these horrible fights, have sex, he\u2019s super nice to her for a day, then it\u2019s back to normal. it gets tiring living with them. the next part of this, i love her, like a lot. i\u2019ve never told anyone this because i\u2019m so ashamed of it. i would never make a move on her obviously because i\u2019m not a pos and i love him too despite his flaws. this has seriously affected me, i have trouble dating and finding other girls because of how i feel about her. and i have to come home every day and watch him treat her like absolute shit. i can talk to her and laugh for hours and we\u2019re great friends, i hate seeing her like this. especially last night, when he got mad at her in front of her dad for something so stupid. all 3 of them were going at it for hours and her dad was basically screaming at him and she was flipping out, i genuinely thought they might be done that night. but nope, despite saying unforgivable things to each other, they had sex last night and acted like everything was fine today. the worst part of this is, when they\u2019re fighting sometimes i almost hope they break up. i know the way i feel about her isn\u2019t right, but i can\u2019t help it.\n\ni\u2019m just at this horrible point in my life, i have headaches and chest pain over day here my anxiety, my teeth are being grinded down because i grind them every night in my sleep. i want the pain to be over. i feel lost and alone, and don\u2019t know how to open up to someone about the things wrong with me. any advice is appreciated, i don\u2019t want to be here anymore.",

        "content": "saved by my hallucinations from killing myself, schizophrenic. the only time i have had a benevolent hallucination that wasn't malevolent or trying to tear me down by fear, trying to kill me or drive me insane was when i attempted suicide,\n\ni couldn't handle the voices in my head anymore, the hallucinations that were tormenting me and the debilitating panic attacks. this was happening when i first got diagnosed with schizophrenia, cptsd, panic disorder and depression.\n\ni was out in the elements in a winter storm, i took all my clothes off and drank a whole bottle of vodka to immobilize myself and then i started losing control over my body and fell into the snow, before i was about to end my struggle to go on in life as my body was starting to turn pale from the winter storm and everything started going fuzzy i started seeing dead loved ones, and my friends and family appeared to me and told me they loved me and to save myself, and they were telling me that i mattered and they loved me, lastly my hallucinations explained to me to don't let life get you down.\n\ni started crying because i felt a warmth love wash over me and while i was laying on the ground, a jolt of energy went through my body as i started to yell out, i choose life as tears started flowing from my cheeks and then miraculously was able to barely stand up from my drunkenness because my adrenaline started pumping like crazy, i was seeing everything double vision and i kept losing my balance and kept on stumbling on the street and was using the walls on store fronts to hold me back. my work was nearby, and i knew how to get in because i had the code to the lock that i kept in my wallet because i was in charge of opening and closing and went into the work bathroom and i had the worst sleep that night.\n\nthe next day i had to hide my hands because from the frostbite ordeal and my nose and cheeks were all red, lucky nobody cared because my job was primarily outside anyway, so i was able to hide the frost burns by putting a scarf over my face and wearing gloves. i was hungover and felt sick, weak, and frail that day, but i needed the money for food because i was starving because i was homeless at the time. i was surprised i was still able to work that day.\n\nmy quality of life is better now, i still go through mental illness and ups and downs and even had a panic attack and hallucination yesterday, but i have a mental health treatment team, psychiatrist, medicine, therapist and a home now.\n\nno matter how dark things get, no matter how much it feels like the world is against you\u2014there is always a way forward. you matter. you are loved, even when you can\u2019t see it. life has a way of surprising you when you choose to hold on. keep going. you are stronger than you know.",

        "content": "i just want to die. i\u2019ve been in the navy for 12 years now and just got back from a deployment in october. i\u2019ve been married for 2 years and we met after my third deployment. a couple months after we started dating we were expecting our son. during the pregnancy we got into it every now and then and the pregnancy was rough. i was at a really low point after i got back and when we got into it i was talking to someone briefly but we worked things out and i stopped talking to her. a month after our son was born we got married and i transferred to a new ship. my wife found out about the tinder and she told me what a piece of shit i was. we worked on it and worked things out and i deployed a year after i got to my current ship. when we got back everything was go go go but it was a good place minus a little post deployment depression. \n\nthe post deployment depression caused some arguments and i\u2019d been quiet and monotoned and trying to figure out how to adapt to being a family man again and turning the work mode off. i love my wife and son more than anything in this world but my depression has been pushing my wife away. she pitched the idea of an open relationship partly because she wanted to do what i did to her and i didn\u2019t want to but i agreed because in my mind it\u2019s only fair right? plus i figured it would be the only way i\u2019d be able to save this. \n\n(now to today) she\u2019s been hanging out with him and told me she doesn\u2019t want to do anything with me because we have stuff to work on in our home life and i need to go to therapy or it\u2019s a divorce. so i got into therapy gladly. i told her i wanted to cut the open relationship because i wasn\u2019t doing anything and refused to do anything and she was still on there. she spends a lot of time with him and i stay at home with our kid. i\u2019m to the point in life because i don\u2019t want to lose my wife. i love her and i love our son. the feeling of seeing her hanging out with another man who doesn\u2019t know about me kills me. she gives him attention and just comes home and we barely do anything because \u201cwe have stuff to work on at home.\u201d \n\ni mentioned something about going to the cliffs where we went on one of our first dates and got to thinking that night about just going by myself and instead of turning, just keep driving straight off of the cliffs. ive thought about going to a shooting range and either just shooting myself there, or pocketing a 9mm bullet and bringing it home and doing it here. i\u2019ve thought about slitting my wrists or throat or just getting into a car crash on my way to work.\n\ni\u2019ve gotten to the point where i ended up sitting in my car crying before work on the phone with the military suicide crisis hotline and texting them at work. i dont want to lose my family and i dont want to lose my life but at the same time i just want the pain to end.

        "content": "i want to kill myself again i dont think im going to change. im a hurt person who hurts other and i dont like it. i was diagnosed at 15 with major depressive bipolar and have always self sabotaged the good things that happen. on december 6th, 2024, i was discharged after 3 months in being in a dual rehab facility for drugs and mental health. i was sober until february 5th of this year when i smoked weed with friends. i havent been using pills (which is what i was in rehab for) but i have been drinking more. 2 nights ago, when i blacked out for the first time since september 23rd, 2024 (not the first time i drank since then but the first i blacked out) i told my closest friend and now we're no longer talking. i messed it up. not only has that blackout been a spiral, my brother is leaving and ive been doing so bad that i want to kill myself again. my brother is the only person here for me and is the only one making this house bearable since i still live with my parents, but he's moving out. my house is the worst place to be at bc my verbally abusive father and particularly absent mother. but im constantly stuck here since i do online school and have no friends. im 17 and have no idea what adult life is like and its starting to unfold in front of me and i feel crazy. i finish highschool this year and idk what to do w my life. i can barley take care of myself rn and idk how to do that alone bc i cant do it w ppl around me. im failing highschool (which is my fault) and i broke my sobriety (also my fault) why do i keep fucking things up? then when my parents or therapist want to talk i shut down or yell. i did so good in rehab and was the best ive been mentally and physically since like 8 years old, but messed it up when i got home. ive been doing therapy since i was 12 and i have the help i need, i just dont take it. trust me i want to do good, bc ik i deserve good. i dont know why i cant let myself be happy. i want it more than anything and i try, so hard. but i keep trying and nothing gets anywhere so i tend to give up. im tired of giving up, why cant it just work out? i want to be able to thrive in life and succeed in my future but i cant if i keep letting myself fail. picturing myself as a happy thriving adult isnt something i can see. and when i do take the help i need and keep trying to do good, something happens and i let myself fall down again. its a repeating cycle of wanting to do better, doing better, failing, spiraling, then wanting to do better again. part of me wants to do better, but part of me is comfortable in the depression. so all in all, even though i dont want to change (but i do), and im a bad person (but im not) and i hurt others (but i dont want to), am i doomed? is it still possible to change if part of you doesnt want it?

        "content": "lessons from someone who's wasted and ruined most of their youth. i've never exactly been quite right. my emotional control, processing speeds, and risk avoidance were all terrible. \n\nfor the longest time, up until a few years ago, i thought this was just what everyone dealt with and that it was unchangeable and to just live with it. but then i realized that people don't think about suicide daily, they're motivated and disciplined to do the things they want to do (and they have things they want to do), they aren't dependent on others to survive, they aren't angry and spiteful constantly, they have the ability to hold down and keep a job, and many can do this without unhealthy behavioral addictions or constant procrastination.\n\nokay, fair enough! i thought. i just have to stop doing stupid shit, work hard, and put myself out there, and these things will go away, right? so i stopped eating unhealthy, went to the gym, starting going to clubs and making friends, found a field (i thought) i was interested in, found part-time employment during school, managed my mental health conditions, even lived on my own for a while and had an so! did any of that change how i felt fundamentally?\n\nnah.\n\nbeing alone forever doesn't scare me anymore.  my old friend group and ex hate me because i can't control my emotions. everyone i've formed relationships with is gone, either because they couldn't handle me or i couldn't handle them. it's pretty much just my biological family left. i quite literally live in my grandparent's basement, doing nothing but staring at the ceiling or at my phone hoping that someone says hi or what i'm up to. i have no real hobbies, because the only ones i had in the past were unhealthy consumerist ones like watching youtube, playing video games (alone), or making food. nothing creative interests me because my brain is fried from years of overconsumption. having the skill level of an average 13 year old in everything new i try when i'm already at my limit doesn't help either.\n\ni cannot picture myself working any job other than a warehouse or construction job making the same as my parents who sacrificed everything for me and love me unconditionally. i don't even care that i'm 20k in debt, don't have a job, and hate my bachelor's program that i'm in (which has taken 7 years+). i have no internships, no projects, no marketable work experience of any kind to show for it, other than a factory job i held for a year 3 years ago. i'm 24, going into the prime of my adult years, basically in the same position as when i was 15. with my current path, i cannot see myself living past the age of 30.\n\ni have set a timer for myself. my 25th birthday is at the beginning of august. if something substantial does not change by then, in spite of my best efforts.. the basement rafters will provide good support. i know how to tie a rope. i am tired and want it to end. i don't care about anything corporeal anymore. \n\n i wasted precious time going down the wrong path and focusing on the wrong things. do not do what i did.

        "content": "environmental/biodiversity worries making me feel somewhat suicidal so recently i've escaped feeling suicidal after figuring some stuff out, but it's kinda coming back. unfortunately i made the mistake of going down a bit of an environment rabbit hole, and like jesus christ. i swear like every second journal article is talking about the end times and how soon all the insects and nature and fish will be gone, and same thing with reddit. i tried asking about nature in an optimism subreddit and i literally just got the exact same like apocalypse stuff. i'm someone who tries to stay positive about this stuff and acknowledge all the good work being done, but it is hard to do so when there's so much overwhelmingly negative stuff, and i don't know what to do. i think any sort of ecological collapse would be too much to bear and i couldn't live with that. and yeah i know it's not good to doomscroll and go down these rabbit holes, but now that i've done it i can't get the worries out of my head. like i can't exist in a world without wilderness and animals, but that seems to be what every journalist and redditor is saying. i feel pretty stuck with this, any advice would be so so appreciated thanks",

        "content": "i have nothing to offer the world i'm 21. in college due to qualifying for free tuition, but it's just for something to do-- i was hoping it'd interest me. i've never had any dreams or hopes for the future. i'm failing my classes and i'm considering dropping out entirely. i've applied for disability but it'll be around june or july before i hear anything, and i have low expectations on getting approved (from what i've heard from others); i have a debilitating back injury and i can't walk or stand for more than a few minutes. i've got shooting pain all the time, even with medication.\n\ni've worked several jobs over the years (started at 15), and i just wasn't made for the work culture we're all in today. i worked short hours, long hours, part-time, nearly full-time-- all different postions doing work. but i was miserable the entire time. any kind of social interaction drains me, and there's nothing that has ever really interested me besides writing.\n\nbut writers aren't paid well. it's either winning the metaphorical lottery that i publish a book and get sales, or.... nothing. i've written something to publish sometime. not here to self-promo, but i mention it because i feel like if it's posted and there's no one, i'm probably going to end things. it might seem dramatic, but i'm so tired of living in a world where money is everything. i don't want to be rich. i don't want nice things. i just want to live. but all i have to offer are my words, and they aren't worth anything.\n\ni never thought i'd live past 18, and now it's like i'm stuck in limbo. what place in the world is there for someone like me? just to be a burden on my parents to live with them? to not have a job? to only have aspirations for something that is laughable for trying to chase after? i'd feel better if i was on disability; at least then i'd be contributing to something.\n\nnot here to get political, but all the shit going on in the (us) government is so tiring. i feel like i'll get accepted in a few years on disability, only for it to be cut. for rights to be taken away. i can't move because that also costs money, i don't have my passport updated (trans & it's been over a decade), and no one wants someone like me in their country. a depressed, anxious, disabled writer. i have nothing to offer. i don't see a future for myself. even if i get lucky enough to find a high paying job, how long until i'm able to afford a house? food? a regular paycheck? health insurance? i have nothing. what worth is there in investing in a future i will most likely never achieve? i don't have wants for a relationship, a family, kids, anything-- i feel like i wasn't made to live in this world. i'm already miserable like this.\n\ni have a cat that i love more than anything. she keeps me here. but she won't live forever. one day i'll be some nobody writer and she won't be here, and all i'll be is a burden on my family. they don't deserve that. they don't need me as a leech on them. there will come a day in my future where i either feel safety or i know it's over. it won't be worth it to have me alive. all i'll be is just a waste of oxygen. i already feel like that now.\n\ni don't feel like i was made to live in this world. i'm too sensitive, i'm too sad, and i'm too anxious. and now i can barely walk. at least with a physical disability, people now can see that i'm injured. i feel like a disappointment. realistically, i'll publish something, it won't sell, i won't find something else, and i'll kill myself. i'll at least do it all the way. i've already been through enough pain, i don't want to try any more. i feel like i was just born to rot. i'm so tired. where is there a spot for me to exist? what purpose do i have to live if i can contribute nothing? what worth do i have now as a 21-year-old? when i'm 31? 41? the more time that passes the worse i feel. i don't know what to do, and i hate this. i wish i could just grit my teeth and bear things, but i can't. and i'm useless for that. a disappointment. that's all i'll ever be.",

        "content": "what should i live for? having read some of the posts in this group makes me think that i should enjoy the life that i have. i at least am not being coerced by caregivers whom i am financially dependent on. life would not be disastrous, since i would be graduating from a decent university but i just can't find happiness in spite of anything. \n\ni have pmdd, meaning i will feel suicidal 1-2 days before my period each month, and on the first 1-3 days of my period i would feel crippling pain where i struggle to move from my room. that is not to say that this month in particular, the suicidal thoughts have not died and have continued for 5 days. i have received a positive result from an autistic screening and i am still finding resources to get an adhd screening. from patterns of motivation and energy slumps, i highly suspect that i have extremely low dopamine levels too. \n\nbefore anyone tells me to see a gp, i will tell you, **i have**. i have done so in nz, australia, and the uk. all they can advise for my period pain is painkillers (which does little to reduce the pain i think i have developed immunity to them). i am tired of trying different anti-depressants and have them not work and still mess up my hormones. mental health support is shit at my university and i can tell that my tutor does feel uncomfortable when i want to discuss more serious issues and is really there for the happy news. even though treating student welfare is their job. \n\nmy neurodivergence is also a result of my terrible sense of time and planning, meaning it would be very difficult for me to achieve a job that i want. i am terrible with dealing with new tasks that are unexpected and want routine, but a mundane office job will be so useless that i will hate my life from the lack of meaning i make. i feel like i have always disappointed my supervisors from asking for extensions, and cannot imagine the sort of things they will write in my reference letters. \n\nso i just don't understand what i can live for. i really admire people who have more energy than i do and have a drive. i don't, i want to, but i can't. nothing in life brings me happiness. i don't want to fight my in built low dopamine levels, not to say the waves of depression brought about from pmdd. my aunt also suffers from pmdd (she also feels suicidal each month) but at least she has a natural ability to feel happiness during normal times which she can hold on to for hope when the time comes each month. i feel tired of battling mental and physical pain, while feeling low energy at all times that i am just barely hanging by a thread. on top of that, no one around me understands and assume i am just overreacting or making up my symptoms. \n\nand how exactly have people reacted to my symptoms?\n\npmdd? then it must be the 'womanly hysteria' that is blown out of proportions and attention seeking, when i am sat here planning how i should kill myself and am wondering when i will hit the buy button on amazon for charcoal and imagined disabling the fire alarm in my room. \n\nadhd/autism? i get lumped in with tiktokkers or in general a lot of people in the 15-25 age group who claim to have neurodivergence when their symptoms are either very mild or not noticeable at all. so they assume i am just claiming extra welfare benefits. or that based on my struggles with multi-tasking as a reason that i shouldn't work in their sector - the issue is, no sector would accommodate these traits!\n\nlow dopamine levels? they lump that in with laziness or inability to work well as an employee/student/friend to hang out with.\n\nsuicidal? behold, people will begin to look at me like i am somewhat tainted, or not a good buddy they can hang around with to have fun. or that they avoid me thinking i will break down if i am not beaming a smile 24/7. or that they, having probably never listened or met someone who struggled, would just say \"please find help\" (it would feel like the typical admin response of delegating the responsibility onto another party when i have gone to them for help), \"just feel happy\" (mate, do you think i would be here if i could just choose)?\n\njust, what should i live for? i have barely pulled through with the depression and can feel it fading, but all i am left with is the period pain, the people i have left on read in social media and people i need to reply in my inbox (including my supervisors). by the time i have sorted through them, i will have 2 weeks of mediocrity before the depression hits again. assuming that screwing up academic work or social connections hasn't triggered an anxiety attack first. \n\n\n\n",

        "content": "suicide attempt (a lil bit funny) hi everyone!! this is a story about my attempt(?) from 2022. \n\n1. what triggered me\n\nbasically i told my mom about my suicidal thoughts, and she said 'go ahead and do it', when i started to argue about how horrible what she said is, she said that 'it's a form of manipulation and i'm not falling for that'\n\ni went to my room and searched suicide statistics in my country. only 1% actually died when attempted to swallow pills, so it was not an option; meanwhile, the attempt of jumping had 30%. i didn't really see any other methods for myself, so i picked this one. \n\ni wrote a suicide note and putted it in my jeans; then, she came to my room and attempted to hug me. i said not to bother me, and she left angrily, screaming.\n\n2. how i searched for a building \n\ni remember that i was in the state of affect, probably due to a strong shock and bouleversement. i had no coherent thoughts at this point, just the mission to find a building to jump off from. \n\nall the buildings near me, including my own, were pretty low, so i had to go pretty far away. one, two, three - every damn roof was closed. \n\ni even tried to sneak into a hotel building. i literally waited until the guard will go from the post to sneak in there like in some fucking stealth game. i succeeded,  but yeah, guess what? roof closed\n\n3. how i scared a man\n\ni entered yet another building elevator with a young man. we greeted each other and smiled. he looked kinda confused and nervous, i didn't undestand why; ends up, he lived in the last floor (to which i destinated , obviously), and the floor only had one apartment, his own\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nstill not getting it, i left the elevator and went to the short stairs to the roof. of course, goddamn closed \n\ni went back. and there was an old man standing, and looking at me from the doorstep of his apartment (the young man probably told him about me bruh\ud83d\ude2d). damn let me tell ya , his gaze was terrifying and he stared directly at me. i rushed to the elevator fastly. \n\n4. how i stuck on the parking lot\n\ni was not really thinking from the panic, and hit the parking lot floor accidentally. as a left, the door back to the elevator was stuck. \n\nthere were no people in there (it's a day of the weekend where, in my country, nobody works and allat shit, everybody either on the beech or at home), and i just started to try and enter random doors, everything was stuck/closed idk.  i started having panic attack\n\ni already wanted to call the police so they'll save me, but then some car entered, so the gates opened and i sneaked outta there. \n\n5. end\n\ni kinda came to my senses because of the panic lol, i told my close friend (to which i'm already not talking) about everything in a voice message\n\nthen i continued walking. honestly idk why, but then my mom called me and asked me where i am. i named the street and she was kinda bewildered bc i was literally in the end of the town \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nthen my mom offered to go around in the city center, so we did that. my mom doesn't know about the whole thing though, but my dad does. \n\nthe end:p\n\np.s. if you have any questions i'll gladly answer lololol. the thoughts still didn't go away, but now i remember this situation as a funny one",

        "content": "tried suicide after infidelity yesterday. will possibly try again soon i overdosed yesterday, and luckily didn\u2019t get admitted. i told the doctors i was in an accident recently, and took too many painkillers at once. i don\u2019t really remember what happened beyond that. just felt very tired and goggly. my boyfriend of 7 emotionally (and possibly physically) cheated with several other women and gave me an std that caused cancer in my cervix. after 7 months of giving my love, money, and attention to this man, he has given me nothing but more distrust, sicknesses, and pain. when his dad passed away recently, i was there for him when i thought noone else was. i thought the giving him the space he wanted was so he could grieve, but he only used that opportunity to cheat on me. being this deceitful while mourning loss is rather new to me, so it was hard for me to see the red flags originally. then again, this has happened to me before, and countless more times. \n\ni understand i shouldn\u2019t kill myself over one person, but this kind of pain is something i can never get used to. the pain of feeling rejected, used, lied to, betrayed. ive felt it all my life. i can\u2019t keep going. i will more than likely shoot myself instead. so that i may finish the job.",

        "content": "(mentions of zoophilia). everything has been going awful. i planned to kill myself some time between a few years from now and my 30th bday, just so i can experience some more life, but i've been contemplating it more and more lately i've had plans to kill myself some time before i turn 30. i just don't feel like i'm prepared for the world based on my living situation and how i was raised. i don't feel like i could handle a job properly, pay rent, food, bills, and all that other adult stuff.\n\nat home i'm pretty much the only one (out of 6) that keeps the house together. my should-be bedridden mom also helps but she isn't really in a position to do all that, no one else helps or has jobs or anything like that, they just sit around on their asses.\n\nmy life feels the same day in day out, nothing new or exciting ever happens. it's always wake up with back pain, get my meds, spend 20 minutes trying to watch something on youtube that i've already seen a million times and am tired of, eat, stay in my room, eat the same damn frozen burritos for lunch, sometimes dinner, and sleep. i'm so fucking tired of those burritos but i don't have much of a choice for other foods.\n\ni'm also struggling with being single. i'm an incredibly physical person and just want to be in a relationship. i haven't even had so much as a hug in months. i can't stress this enough but i quite literally don't have any friends due to depression, anxiety, and some trauma bullshit.\n\ni'll keep this brief but also all the political stuff going on around the world is only greatly adding to my stress.\n\n!!this is where the zoophilia comes in!!\n\n>!i am a zoophile. i know that lot's of people want the death of me just for that lol, but i follow what's called the zeta principle, which is the zoophile ethical treatment of animals. i would never wish to do harm to an animal, and in fact quite the opposite; i want to give them the best life i ever possibly could. get them all the best foods, toys, go out for walks, dog parks, grooming, and all that other fun stuff to just put their quality of life through the roof. it's also not just a sexual thing, i don't want a pet just for sex, there is a romantic element.!<\n\n>!with that being said, it's one of the few things keeping me going is the fleeting hope that maybe some day i'd be able to just settle and have a nice relationship where we're all happy. the more life goes on though the less likely i realize it'll happen. not only cause it's super fround upon and i'd get a lot of shit for it, but like if i can't even get a decent job, how would i ever expect to be able to gift my partner lots of wonderful things.!<\n\nit's ironic since it's one of the few things keeping me going, but the more i realize how unrealistic and unlikely it is, it just makes me want to kill myself even more. it's a bit ironic and silly. well maybe not silly, i'm just trying to laugh through the pain.\n\ni've thought about overdosing on my meds but i don't know if i'll get really sick and through up and shit, i'd rather just pass out or something but i don't know the symptoms of overdosing. i think the most likely way i'd do it is just sit on the tracks just a block from the house.....",

        "content": "i dont feel like theres a way out for months i havent seen a way out of this. i try to find a solution logically but every different route i could try would end in more pain for me or for others. many people would be lucky to have the life i have. im a 20 year old guy and i go to a good university and im relatively healthy. but mentally im crippled. ive been doing bad all my life but the last 3-4 years have been nothing but hell except brief periods of relief. when i was still underage i tried to ask for help but was denied, since then i gave up because whats the point in waiting 6 months for a psychologist appointment.\n\ni was abused by my father my entire life until last summer when i finally cut contact with him, i still have regular nightmares about him coming back and whenever i hear a car that sounds similar to his i freeze up in fear. my mother managed to leave him when i was around 5 after years of fighting every day but i still had to see him multiple times a week and now i was the one he took all his frustration and anger out on. my mother knew about it but she was so scared of him too so she couldnt do anything about it. she was also very emotionally unavailable. ive never been told i was loved or that they were proud of me. all my achievements were expected. my father forced so many things on me and if i refused i had to face his anger thus i never learned to say no or to stand up for myself. i most likely have autism but i was never tested because my family situation made it impossible for my mom to have time for that. from the ages of 4 to 11-12ish i didnt have a single friend, i was bullied, beaten almost every day because i was different and no one wanted to talk to me. i hated going to school but i hated going home even more and even in my free time i was in trepidation waiting for my dad to call me because he wanted to take me to his place. this caused me to have severe anxiety issues and 0 social skills.\n\ni started making online friends who had similar issues to me. eventually i met a girl who gave me a little attention and validation and i was instantly hooked, then i got treated like shit but i was so attached and so depressed for months until i met someone new. and this cycle of being given a little attention and then being hopelessly attached and tortured by them has been going on for years. i thought i had bpd but i dont know anymore. but last year i met someone who was different, she was so unique and had so redeeming qualities, so beautiful and we were so compatible. for the first time in my life i felt like i could breathe. i was happy. i stopped doing drugs. i was doing better academically. everything was so perfect and peaceful. my nightmares stopped. i was planning for the future. i felt like that even if something bad happened i still had her, she was a constant in my life. she had her own mental problems but i was trying to take care of her and would have stayed with her through everything. but basically she left me for another guy. its been almost 2.5 months since then. i go from not eating for days to overeating but overall ive managed to lose 10kg. i havent been able to sleep properly and every night im tormented by nightmares or dreams of her. i hate going to sleep but i hate waking up in the morning even more. she is doing bad mentally right now too and i tried to help to no avail. it really hurts that all i need to feel better is her but my presence does nothing to her. i wish i knew why i wasnt enough. i wish i would know so i could change. i wish she didnt give up on me. i wish i could see her again. i wish we could go through life together and be there for eachother.\n\nbut i have given up. there is nothing i can do anymore. if i continue going on only more pain awaits me. i havent been going to my classes for the past 2 weeks. even as im writing this i have a pretty important test but i dont have any strength to get out of bed. exams are coming up but im very behind. i feel guilty for being a disappointment, for being so lazy but i just cant do it. i really tried, for years but her leaving me was the final nail in the coffin. she was just such an amazing person and i feel like i cant live without her being part of my life. i know its not normal, but frankly what even is normal about me. i am tired of being tormented by life. i dont think i deserve all this.  why do i not deserve any gentleness and kindness. ive struggled and struggled and overcame every obstacle and i thought she was the reward for all that suffering but no, she was sent by life to destroy any fraction of hope i had left.\n\ni know the method, ive written the notes. i just have to gather enough courage. i think im still waiting for some miracle to happen and even writing here is like some kind of last ditch effort but i know nothing good will happen to me",

(tried to pursue a lawsuit and failed) i had just moved so i had no savings and eventually sold my car just to stop myself from being evicted. \n\ni\u2019m now underemployed at a restaurant only making $38k a year. when i qualified for the apartment i live in now i was making $86k. i\u2019ve been trying to find work in my field marketing and communication since i got let go but now the economy and job market is tanking and i\u2019ve pretty much been living check to check. i don\u2019t feel confident moving again right now because i have three eviction attempts on my record from my current complex from the 6 months that i was unemployed. who would rent to me? and my income is damn near below poverty line. i often have $0 left over from pay period to pay period and have to jump the turnstile on the train just to get to work because i don\u2019t have $2.50. i don\u2019t have a food, transportation, a relationship, a pet or family i\u2019m close with. i have estranged myself from the small network of friends i had because of the shame of being broke and mentally ill. everyone always says it will get better but when? it\u2019s been nearly two years already i can\u2019t take two more. it\u2019s difficult for me to enjoy life enjoy hobbies i used to when i literally haven\u2019t eaten that day. i find myself sleeping all day when i\u2019m not at work just so i don\u2019t have to think about how hungry and depressed i am. applied for food stamps and was denied. \n\ni hate it when people say \u201cyou\u2019re needed\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re important\u201d and \u201cvalued\u201d in this world to me. because i\u2019m needed for what exactly? to lay in my bed depressed everyday and sling fried chicken at some shitty restaurant and dodge homeless people and drug addicts on my walk home at night? i\u2019m needed to work and pay bills? idgaf about being needed or making a difference. if i have to live in misery i\u2019d rather not live at all. if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that i can\u2019t find a pain free way to die i woulda been killed myself already",

        "content": "tired of it all and literally nobody can change that. people in my life complain about how i'm 'too hard on myself'. but i have every right to be because i'm 29 in a few weeks and i destroyed everything because i'm afraid of my stupid controlling parents. or more so, my volatile father with anger issues. but i still destroyed everything. too afraid to move out in my current state, because dad knows where my partner lives at the moment. the last time he knew i was moving out 3 years ago he threw a fit! and my mom manipulates me and says i can't move because i don't make enough money!! none of them will die, my dad nearly died of a heart attack years ago and i wish he did. my mom has health issues. no dice. they're going to be here for the rest of my life lol.  and even if they die, they're trying to sicc me or my older brother in taking care of my higher needs brother who is aggressive and destructive and needs to go to a group home. but i know i'm going to be forced to, even though i mentally can't. because my older brother is the golden child and they let him do anything. \n\nhe makes over 100k but i know i'm going to be the burden. i can't move out even if i want to because i have no money. and college is getting more expensive by the end of the year and i don't want to take out loans but i have to. i want to find a job but i'll have no luck and who knows if my parents will bitch at me if i get a job. my mom complains when i apply for a food or a retail job. i've had gigs work at home but my dad got mad because. he has to get the $500 dependent costs and if i have any sign of having a job it's bad news.\n\ni can't tell them anything. when i was more public about having a boyfriend they seemed to hope that i would break up with him and my entire family (including those who visited) were weird and invasive about him. it was hard telling my parents i was dating. but now i know i should hide everything from them. i didn't even tell them i transitioned to online college. not like they were supportive anyways. they just whine that i switched from arts to communications but also. they just shat on every college decision i made. why should i tell them? they weren't supportive in driving me there. they're not even supportive with helping me get my license.\n\nmy boyfriend acts like i'm doing the right thing but i think i'm just stupid. he's eventually going to get sick of me anyways because i'm so depressed and miserable. \n\ncan't talk about killing myself because it scares people!! or it's a cry for help .it's not a cry for help when i'm really going to fucking do it by 30 if things don't get better.  already beginning to self harm but i wish i could actually scratch or do something deep enough to leave a scar\n\ngotta pretend to be 'okay' with friends and lie that i slept, because i'm just going to irritate them too! when i confided my friend about these issues they just acted like 1. i was going to stay in my state (i'm not anyways) and 2. that i could move in with my bf and his sister and brother in law. but i don't think i can because i will definitely get into an argument with his sister or brother in law with how they raise the kids. the children seem aggressive, scream, and hurt the pets. as you can tell, that's a situation that'll really fucking trigger me.\n\ni can't move in with anyone either because i have no friends because again, i'm stupid. i destroyed and sabotaged every friendship i had. not like i can socialize anyways, no car, no nothing. the only socialization is through the internet for the most part and my mom mocks me for that too. \n\nantidepressants seemed helpful but i had to get off those because i still wanted to die. and all my mom does now is complain about how i gained 50 pounds through it.\n\nmy entire life is a nightmare and the state of the united states and everything makes it worse. i feel so nauseous. i already fucked my life up. not through drugs or alcohol like a normal person. i fucked it up by  being a fucking loser. could've left even sooner if i didn't listen to my parents' opinions on community college. i was dependent on them and it ended up taking me 6 years to get a stupid associate's degree.\n\ni sincerely don't believe it 'gets better'. i wish i killed myself when i was 18. but at least i can change things now before it's too fucking late and i spent my entire life like this. which i will. i know i will. i'm done. nothing even makes me happy anymore it's painful and sleep is so hard. there's literally no point anymore.",

        "content": "its always in the back of my mind i have always had suicide in the back of my mind, from a very young age. i suffered abuse and trauma in my early childhood hood. i always figured that someday things would get bad enough and i would end it.\n\nmaybe because of that i never made long term plans. i recently lost someone and have been diagnosed with bpd. thinking about doing it someday has turned into a constant obsessive thought, and i feel like i am getting closer. sometimes it is the only way i can fall asleep at night, dreaming about ending it soon. i have no appetite and no motivation. my house is a mess and i cannot even muster the energy to do my laundry or brush my teeth. if i owned a gun i would definitely already be dead. \n\ni am in therapy, but when i bring it up i get put in the psych ward for 72 hours and nothing happens. i am afraid to talk to my family because it is so terrible. the only one i can talk to is my wife, but even she has grown tired of me. i keep dropping hints hoping that she will pick up on exactly how bad it is, but she does not realize one of these days i am going to be gone. i feel like the day is getting very close. i really just want the suffering to be over.

        "content": "tried to talk to my school counselor and now i feel more alone and suicidal (long post) a few weeks ago, i made a very very terrifying step....i reached out for help for the first time. i never do that because im used to suffering alone and im terrified of vulnerability. i had to spend days preparing for this, yep...it was that overwhelming for me. the last straw was one of my friends ignoring me without any explanation and i just had enough. i was already on the edge and i knew that one wrong word from the counselor will push me to act on my plan. i already knew what i was going to do, but for some reason i wanted to reach out one last time. maybe because i knew i won't be here much longer. so i stepped in on that office, not knowing what to expect but at the same i already know i will be disappointed. i was so scared. i could only talk to him about having some issues with my friends.  he even recommended bringing my friends at the office to sort it out and i quickly said no. i was scared of letting them help me. i didn't really want to go into details with him, like with my self harm, suicide thoughts and plans, since i couldn't trust him yet and i know once i tell them those he might try to involve my parents which will make things worse. i could only open up about feeling bad for hurting my friends unintentionally, and how one of them called me selfish for being depressed.  i was trying not to cry. and then he told me \"maybe you're actually being selfish.\" and thats when i knew. he didn't see it wasn't just friend drama. i was disappointed but not surprised. i left that office feeling more alone and not getting the help i need. i physically felt hope leave my body. ofc i knew one session wouldn't be enough so i tried to come back since he actually told me so. but he wasn't there. i came back like 3 times. i felt more embarassed and desperate (because he was also my teacher\ud83d\ude2d). i was so upset i self harmed at the school bathroom. this wasn't just a small thing for me because when you have been struggling for so long you feel too ashamed to ask for help. unfortunately the mental health system at my school is shitty so the staff are overburdened. i tried emaling him asking when we can talk again, i waited...for days. my time was coming. i knew i couldn't hold on anymore. he didn't respond. i was so hopeless. i saw him at class the next day and he acted like he didn't care or at least didn't saw how desperate i was. i was so deeply embarassed for even asking for help. i didn't try to talk to him anymore because i didn't see the point anymore. also i got more scared of him because i felt like i was bothering him. i feel so alone and i feel liek no one will be able to help me anymore. i have been planning my suicide for months. i already have the means, wrote the letters, gave away things, resigned to my decision everyday. so i can't back out anymore. i feel so trapped and i just want it to stop. i feel like a burden to everyone and i feel like after i kill myself everyone will be glad. im tired of pretending and i hope i can do it soon.",

        "content": "she\u2019s gone and now i get it i don\u2019t know how to say this. but i guess this is the place where when  the thoughts are starting to win you share. i try not to read people\u2019s trauma on here, some of it is triggering. mainly because i\u2019m not well enough to empathize, especially when lately i\u2019ve been feeling the same fucking way. it\u2019s not like i want to encourage these thoughts of others. i just have nothing to say to help anymore. i tried at first too. i really did but i didn\u2019t have the heart. \n\nthis is a sad story. this is not going to be an easy read. even for those of you who have heard horror stories of abuse and neglect. this isn\u2019t one of those stories. but this one is a god damned tragedy, in 3 parts. \n\nto protect the identity of the deceased i will be changing their names. \n\nback in 2020, during the crazy ass lockdowns i reconnected with an ex from 8 years earlier. a lot had happened in our lives and after texting non stop for two days (after years of never speaking) we met up. and that was it. we rarely left each others sides for years. it was love, a hard fought and rekindled love. she was feisty and gorgeous, funny and smart. damn me if she wasn\u2019t the best thing to ever happen to me. when we dated all those years ago we were both stupid. she was always comparing me and treating me like i was her ex. he was abusive and mean, cheater type. i was the yo, peace and love and let me go party type. and she\u2019d come with me she just didn\u2019t trust me, because she didn\u2019t trust him. and i partied a little too hard back then. so, we broke up. but fast forward again to 2020, i found my love again, my rainbow. \n\nrainbow and i, like i said, hit it off again on a whole other level. life in those 8 years changed us. i got a medical condition that needed constant monitoring and she was recovering from a life changing surgery, while also grieving her recently passed father. the first 6 months back together was strange but fun. and something i never expected. i was madly and boldly in love with her. i couldn\u2019t even express it because i thought i knew what love was, but rainbow just had a way of making it easy. \n\non the day we started hanging out again her sister, marie, brought a sweet little bulldog puppy over named sue-bee. she was so ugly and adorable and slobbery! everything you want from a dog. rainbow was babysitting her for a week for marie\u2019s friend. marie and i knew each other for years, and talked on occasion via facebook debating politics or music. just friendly chatter. but she didn\u2019t recognize me at first. longer hair, facial hair, maybe a little extra around the midsection. but once she figured it out, we were all back in like the old days. \n\nthe things about rainbow and marie that everyone should know is they were tight! these sisters loved each other like none other. marie five years older than rainbow, always took care of her little sister. even when it was unnecessary, because that\u2019s what big sisters do. and that, and i\u2019m not sugar coating this because of what\u2019s to come in this story but truly mean it; they were the nicest women you would of ever met. your nice aunt that everyone loves? or your best friends mom who has mr rogers energy? like that, they both had it. the givers of love, shirts off their back, anything. \n\n so, i lucked out. their mom, mary, loved me too. she still does. very much so. but the years went on with our life, wasn\u2019t the best life but was almost perfect. until i got sick in 2022 and my disease took my out for almost a year. couldn\u2019t work, had to rehabilitate my body. the whole time marie and rainbow were in my corner. marie would just leave money in my jacket pocket so i could pay bills or buy groceries. i\u2019d say what the hell is this and she would say i don\u2019t know where that came from. you must of forgotten it was there. and never in a condescending way, just because she cared for me and more importantly for her little sister, rainbow. \n\nthese women, they\u2019d sing to each other at night in facebook messengers voice messages. and when they got together they would sing and dance. that one song, i can still hear marie sing echoing through my memory; record player by ajr and i can\u2019t remember the females artists name. though she commands in that song. marie would sing it all the time. and rainbow, what wouldn\u2019t she sing? anything from the dolly parton movie best little whorehouse in texas, hamilton, the greatest showman; usher\u2026shit anything from the 1990s when we grew up. \n\ntragedy 1 \n\nyou never think the last day you\u2019re spending with someone is something you need to burn into you memory. but luckily, it was one that will forever stay with me because it meant so much to me. \n\nin august of 2023, we decided to do a family camping trip. momma mary was flying in from colorado and marie and her husband dick were taking a few days off work. the day before everyone was to be at camp marie and i spent the whole day together setting everything up. driving out into the middle of nowhere off the side of a private lake that belonged to a family friend. it was beautiful there. we went shopping, found an old mountain spring to get water out of (took like two hours of looking but we found it!) and also got some burgers at a roadside bar. and they were good! \n\nthat night i come back home, marie drops me off and leaves. the next day she picks momma up from the airport and picks rainbow and i up, and our dog icarus as well. \n\nwhen we get to camp dick is about an hour behind. we finish setting up our clothes and blankets and start relaxing. dick shows up in his truck and we start making hot dogs and s\u2019mores. \n\nthat\u2019s when a fucking ground hornet destroyed all our lives. it bite or stung marie on the face. she recently started becoming allergic to bees and wasps, so i immediately administered an epipen as her mother, dick and her got into the truck. she hugged her sister goodbye. \n\nthat was the last time rainbow and i saw marie alive. \n\nby the time we got to the hospital, it was too late. we were too far away and she was brain dead. the worst day of our lives. a beautiful light was extinguished, one such light that had around 40 people in 2 hours come and watch die out. she was that loved. everyone there had a marie did this for me story, or marie did that but said she didn\u2019t. \n\nthe next few weeks were rough. the tragedy never took hold for me, because i was constantly waiting on rainbow. at her side no matter what, if she needed me or anything, i was there. the weeks went on and momma went back home, the holidays came and went and rainbow was sliding into a deep maniac depression. she would talk to her sister or get mad at me for asking her to come with me to speak with someone. i tried so hard to be there but also to give her a push to find some help that i couldn\u2019t give. \n\ntragedy 2\n\nin april of 2024 things got bad. i felt like i was losing her, that she was going to follow her sister in death but by her own hand. i called momma mary and told her i needed help. i was the only family she had around her now. and i can\u2019t do this alone. the next morning she was in my western pennsylvanian driveway, she took a red eye from colorado that night. \n\nand for the next month, slowly; things gots better. no, none of us were happy. yes, it 100% sucked not having marie around but we were getting through it one day at a time as a family. \n\nmomma left, and things stayed level. rainbow was slowly acting like her own self again. the weeks leading up to the anniversary of her sisters passing were going better than i expected. she would dance and sing while cooking again. we\u2019d go on walks and talk about the future, selling our home we had together and moving out west to be closer to momma. we talked about marriage when we got there, and actually being husband and wife. she said, i am your wife. and i said no you\u2019re my fianc\u00e9; you will be my wife. \n\nthe night of the anniversary was strange. come to find out rainbow drugged my food with a sleeping drug called ambien. not a lot, just enough to keep me asleep. because i was out by 4 in the afternoon. and i didn\u2019t wake up until she was long gone, around 2/230 am. when i noticed her gone, i thought maybe she was in a rainbow hider hole. she like the bed up in the attic if she couldn\u2019t sleep and wanted to watch youtube on her phone. or would sit on our neighbors porch talking to him for hours after he got off work. (they were legit best friends) \n\nbut i couldn\u2019t find her anywhere. not next door, not in the attic, not answering her phone. i turned on the light in the dining room to make a call to momma. and that\u2019s when i saw her phone turned off and a small note. it read \u201cfelix, i\u2019ll see you around. i love you, rainbow\u201d \n\nthat was it. \n\nthe next 10 hours are a blur, but eventually we found her. she checked into a red roof in, left a note on the door for the hotel staff \u201cthere is a dead body in this bathroom call the police\u201d she used helium, and ambien. they say it was painless, the officer who found her said she was smiling and looked asleep. at peace he said. \n\nthat was last august. she left everything to me. a whole museum of memories i can\u2019t hide from. and it\u2019s getting harder, man. like\u2026 i know for certain she knew how much i loved her. or that i loved her so much. i guess i don\u2019t know if she understood how much i loved her. she wasn\u2019t just my rainbow, she was my sense in a senseless world. she was my everything. my best friend, my reason for being. my eternal flame. i\u2019m sitting here, in march thinking that maybe she wasn\u2019t wrong, ya know? \n\nit was fucked up that she did it one year to the day of her sister. a hornet ruined my life, took two of the most beautiful women out of this world and out of my life. one, who i was going to have my forever with. one that i still want my forever with. \n\ntragedy 3 \n\ni recently realized, because i never thought about it past my grief; is that i am still madly and boldly in love with rainbow. and everyone says it gets easier, or will get easier but i\u2019m here to tell you all on this dark side of reddit; at least for me, that\u2019s a lie. i\u2019m tired of taking lorazepam to make my chest stop hurting. i\u2019m tired of the blanket her i made on the bed to not hold me back. i\u2019m tired of not hearing her singing downstairs making breakfast or just signing. i lost. i lost so fucking hard. and i\u2019m not seeing the way out anymore. \n\nand i know i should, my therapist says we gotta work through it. everyone grieves differently. thing is, i don\u2019t want to grieve anymore. it sucks. and it hurts. and it\u2019s a lot. my affairs are slowly being put in order. but soon, i won\u2019t have to grieve anymore. because where ever my love went, i\u2019ll find her again. she\u2019s out there, in the universe and i have to find her before it\u2019s too late. before we don\u2019t meet again. \n\nso you might say my mind, like rainbows is made up. hell, she got the helium tank in march of 2024 to use in august. she had the right idea. don\u2019t let people know, keep it to yourself, make a plan and stuck to it. i have 200 units of insulin and a syringe. i know the hotel room and bathtub i\u2019ll be in. same room, same note on the door. no note for anyone but rainbow. it\u2019s gonna say, \u201crainbow, not if i see you first. love always, me\u201d\n\ni feel like i had to tell someone this story. not as a way of crying for help, but the opposite. as someone who can\u2019t deal with this pain and thinks it should be okay to let it go. to face your own destiny. i had a good life, sometimes it was horrible. but i became adult and had fun, treated people well and loved hard. i don\u2019t want this pain anymore. and is that okay? is leaving this way a real crime? \n\nkind of. it felt like it when she did it. oh i was so angry. but now, these months later when the pain has settled into a steady throb in my throat and chest. when it\u2019s becoming harder and grade to pretend that i\u2019m okay. i\u2019m over it. and i miss her. i can\u2019t do this without her. it hurts too bad. \n\ni love you, my rainbow. \ud83c\udf08 \n\ni\u2019ll see you around.",

        "content": "cold turkey wd after 10 yrs on sub, my story...hope it helps i won't bore you with the addiction story...you've probably heard it before...and it ended with the start of this one. i'm a veteran, so i went to the va clinic for help with prescription opiates and was prescribed suboxone...the new (at the time) miracle drug, and for me, it was. it saved my life.\n\nfirst 4 years i was prescribed 24 mg/day and over the next 6 yrs i eventually got it down to 8 mg/day....10 years total on this drug. my dr called it a \"lifetime\" medication. i didn't like that at all.\n\ni also hated the random ua's i needed to submit to stay on it (which were always clean btw), the myriad of side effects i'd experienced over the years and the look of judgement from others after hearing what med i was being prescribed.\n\nthree weeks ago i woke up one morning and decided to quit cold turkey and not be tied to it anymore. i didn't discuss it with my dr ahead of time (i'm certainly not recommending anyone go this route)..i just didn't show for my monthly appt or request a refill. here's how it went for me:\n\ndays 1-3\n\nno physical withdrawal symptoms...maybe a little anxiety for what i (thought) was coming. mentally psyching myself up for it.\n\ndays 4-5\n\nanxiety has definitely set in hardcore. appetite gone. feeling \"antsy\" and irritable. low energy. still bathing daily though. staying positive mentally.\n\ndays 6-8\n\nrls and insomnia arrived. no vomiting, minimal nausea and only one (1/2) visits with the diarrhea fairy. don't trust it's gas during this time. feeling like i'm coming out of my skin. arms, legs and body occasionally jumping(spazzing). irritability has progressed to extreme bitchiness. couldn't even stand it when my toddler touched me. was either laying in my bed or lying in the recliner. hot and cold flashes. all time low on energy. didn't leave the house at all. only showered once in these 3 days.i didn't have the strength to put conditioner in my hair after half-ass washing it...and shaving, ha ha...nope\n\nmentally sending out positive thoughts and energy and directing them to the negative wd symptoms. maybe the mind over matter saying is true because this does seem to help, alleviating the symptoms...for a time, but not long. they come back.\n\nday 9\n\ndelirious from the insomnia. previous symptoms still here, maybe to a lesser degree, thankfully. new symptom is night sweats. soaked shirt and pillow. left the house today but fell asleep in the car while waiting to pick my kids up at school. something has got to give soon...i keep telling myself that.  i attempt to \"mentally will the wd away\" this seems to work for a bit but  it's not enough.\n\nday 10-today (day 20)\n\nresearching online for things to help alleviate the symptoms, homeopathic or otherwise.  kratom keeps popping up....i've got kids, a husband and a life to get back to, you know. so i went to the neighborhood vape shop and got a bag of kratom capsules. no experience with it, have never taken it before so i really had to read a lot online to try and figure out the dosing and let me say, there's not much info out there. but i really needed to get a nights sleep. i took 4 capsules with a huge glass of water two hours before bed. slept for close to 5 hours straight. no rls.\n\nwoke the next morning feeling like maybe the tide had finally turned. i began taking three capsules mid morning, late afternoon and then before bed for the next few days. it took care of all the symptoms except for the lack of energy. still no energy but i was able to return to a version of my life. still experiencing some insomnia here and there. have had night sweats twice. no energy.\n\n\n\n\\*\\* let me be clear\\*\\*  i have no intention of replacing the suboxone with kratom, i understand the biology behind the reason the kratom helps to relieve the symptoms and i also know that the biology/reason is what makes the kratom addictive as well. which is dangerous for me, since i'm an addict. with this in mind, i gauged my symptoms and i began going longer without and consistently taking less of the kratom. now on day 20, i will only take the capsules tonight before bed. maybe tomorrow i wont even take them then.\n\nall in all i feel like if anyone should of had a extremely rough wd it would be me....10 years taking it every day is real dependency. i read so many horrible wd stories and i feel for each of them. but mine wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. yes, there were a few bad days, one in particular where i almost called my dr for a refill. and yes, i found kratom, which almost removed all the physical symptoms. but its not for everyone.  there are some who aren't comfortable with it or feel its just a replacement.\n\ni really did try to stay positive mentally, putting an actual daily effort into sending positive thoughts out and directing them toward the wd. i firmly believe this played a part in lowering the severity of what i experienced.\n\nmy take on this is this.....just as addiction is uniquely personal so is the wd experience. no matter where you are in this journey, hang in there, stay positive and live to fight another day. blessings.\n\n\\* i'll check back periodically if anyone has any questions or comments or have a wd story to share\\*",

        "content": "substance abuse since age 15!! so basically, i think i have some unresolved issues, which i\u2019m not aware of. i started to use marijuana when i was 15. i was an a+ student i never work too hard. then after three years i started to use benzodiazepine then i got admitted into a rehab forcefully for 27 days where i was resisting so they tied me up for the whole day and night. i tear my clothes and they would hit you if you don\u2019t pray or do something which is not to the rules in short i made it out of there but when i come out before i was using it like 10 pills or five pills per day but after the rehab i was using it like 60 to 80 pills per day specifically medazolam which is considered a potent sedative. i was out for two weeks but i totally do not remember those days when i wake up i was in a rehab but different this was a little bit better or maybe because i got used to it and i did not resist it a lot but again when i come out, i started to use marijuana again no one in the family knew and in a month so my father who has a business in another country send us a visa to come there for visit, but when i went there i was looking for alcohol everywhere and finally after a week or maybe five days in the other country i drink and i got blackout the whole night i was vomiting and then my dad decided for us to stay here i was feeling so lonely worthless no vision nothing very bad in between these days, i started to do it for the first time. i did it with someone who i met here and he was using it before then he stopped it but he had it in his house and he gave it to me and when i did it, i felt so free and so worthy that i started to do it daily if i could afford and able to too many fights too many bad things, but when i went back to my country to do exams i started using meth and every kind of like the drugs you can name then when my family come to me i stop using math. i had the withdrawal symptoms for two days but then i felt completely good and when i was coming to this country again back i did an mdma party and then like for five months.i was amazing i was feeling positive. i found my purpose everything but then too much back with the same guy who i started met with who is not using i took marijuana and from that now i\u2019m using it. can i have a note with everything daily but this time it\u2019s different this time? i know this is not for me this time. i know this is a problem this time. i know i have to solve it this time. i know i cannot live like this forever . it\u2019s just i need to know how to go through it before it was different. i was thinking this is my life this is what i want and this is all i have without it. my life is wasted but now i know i have a job a great job i\u2019m earning a lot. i would say i\u2019m lucky and i feel abundance. \n\njust need to know my why? and my how?",

        "content": "support for my son... ok. i am a recovering alcoholic which makes this quite painful and relatable at the same time ...\n\nmy 26 yr old son just admitted to me that he and his wife (they are both trans and just got married) had been doing cocaine for a while and we're having a lot of problems bc of it ... but that they were trying to work it out. that was a couple weeks ago. \n\ni woke up yesterday to my son ranting on fb about how did this happen and about his heart being broken...you get the point. i texted him immediately and he didn't want to talk about it. he just told me they had split up and that he didn't know where it would go from here. he talked about not hurting her like papa had hurt me, but then it has fallen apart for them anyhow. \n\nas far as i can tell (from the little he has shared since then) they are working on it but they both keep posting memes and old pics of each other together and happy all over fb...it absolutely kills me inside bc i don't know how he is feeling and i don't want my first born to go thru another heartache. jesus. he is 26 and he has had enough heartache and stress in his life already. long story, and yes, it involves my alcoholism as a huge part of why he has mental health problems now. i am not pressuring him bc as a mother i want to know but i know from personal experience that if someone is in a state where they truly can not discuss what is happening...that it is better to leave it alone for the moment than to pry. there is a time and place for trying to get him to open up to me, but it is not now. i will wait for him to come to me, and i will sit with my anxiety and deal with it myself and thru my own mental health team bc that is what we do as moms...and should do as humans. empathy and sympathy are free skills to learn people. i will deal with it and let him deal with it and when it's time ... he will come to me. that is our relationship. i will continue to support him 100%.\n\nso my question is how best can i do that? i know nothing about cocaine at all except it's a powder, or you can take it by iv or you can smoke it ... i know little about it's effects. tbh i know know lots more about ketamine abuse than anything bc of elon musk. how sad is that? i just want to know what to say and not to say as he deals with this...both his breakup and the drug use which are related...and separate problems at the same time. he is looking into rehabs and all. he is more than capable but i am here to catch him if he falls. he isn't a person who has abuse issues that have been going on for years, so i'm hoping that he is strong enough to overcome. mama is there for support bc i know how hard it is to kick something like a drug (alcohol) and what it's like to not have support for that. my husband gave me no support as i was struggling with drinking. it took getting so drunk and passing out at a public restaurant to snap me right out of whatever stupidity i was embroiled in at the time. it was a hard decision and it took months to be able to start my abandonment of alcohol. it had been my friend since i was 14 (so since the year 1985) and i officially quit on september 11 2016. yes ... weird date. i know but i was just fed up with being fat and tired and sickly...so i was done. \n\nthanks for your help guys. i empathize but i don't want to make excuses for him or anything. he isn't doing that and he is keeping a positive and proactive attitude about it. i hope y'all are well!",

        "content": "i recently became addicted to a hard drug. trigger warning gonna talk about hard drugs and sexual addiction.\n\n (coming back after writing, this post is very long and a bit jumbled but i hope you might take the time to read it, maybe youll find some value and maybe share your thoughts)\n\nso, i am in my mid twenties and have been having a really rough year. i've been unemployed for almost a year, moved into one of my parents basement, and haven't been doing a good job of maintaining any friendships.\n\ni've been a heavy pot user for a long time, since around 17 years old. i have had periods of time quitting it for a month or multiple successfully. before ever trying weed i became addicted to porn around 12 years old.\n\nporn addiction escalated to sexual addiction. i have fucked more people then i could ever possibly remember. i'm a gay guy and it's incredibly easy to find casual sex in today's world thru a few taps on your phone. i would say my sex addiction has become my biggest problem.\n\nrecently however, i made a really stupid decision when i was feeling really down in december, and i tried smoking crystal for the first time with a hookup. and i really liked it. i found it made it so much easier to talk to people, gave me energy and motivation to clean, and honestly made me more empathetic towards others. also made me not very hungry and i've always struggled with being overweight and over eating so that was a plus for me.\n\ni then proceeded to try a few more times over the next month, and eventually ended up getting some of my own. i did it a handful of times, and ended up going down rabbit holes on reddit and youtube and learning about all the dangers and side effects and all that. i thought i could keep it to like once a month, but quickly found myself doing it every few days, and multiple times a day when i did do it.\n\nit a moment of clarity, i got rid of all of it. and i felt both happy and sad. happy i was able to throw it away for my own sake, but also sad because it felt like the best antidepressent i've ever had. i never thought i would do a hard drug. i'm the type who would always discourage friends from doing that when i had friends lol.\n\nmanaged to be completely sober for almost 2 months, even from weed, because i was scared of the path i was on.\n\nhad to get surgery, and during recovery was pretty down so i picked up weed again, which was fine i just smoked and played games.\n\nbut when looking for a hookup recently, i came across the guy who sold me the crystal, and stupidly got more. because i had gained weight during recovery from surgery, and thought it would help me lose weight/clean my house better.\n\ni now realize that is the addict in me just wanting to feel that high again. i got a 8 ball this last sunday, smoked sunday and monday, break on tuesday (told myself i'd give myself at least a week till trying again).\n\nthen proceeded to wake up today, wednesday, and do some before cleaning up my house. then got alot of stuff done that i've been needing to. smoked a bit more in the afternoon.\n\nand i kept looking up the dangers. the stories of people ruining their life. the permanent damage it can cause. or even death. heart problems. ruins your teeth. people going to prison, becoming homeless, stealing from their families.\n\nand i just can't get out of my head that i've made a massive mistake. that the negatives would far out weigh the positives if i didn't stop.\n\nso i flushed it all down the toilet.\n\ni can't believe i'm addicted to crystal so fast, but i am. i dont wanna ruin my life even more. i'm scared of this path.  after getting rid of everything today i felt the same way i did last time. good and bad. i'm truly addicted. but i know i made the right choice to throw it all away. even if i was basically flushing money down the toilet. i looked myself in the mirror and said i'm proud of you and almost cried.\n\ni feel i am rambling now, but just wanted to share where i'm at.\n\nim addicted to sex, weed, jacking off, video games, and was stupid enough to try a highly addictive hard drug. and now i am addicted to that too.\n\nmy inner child deserves better. he had a really hard childhood and i want to be someone he can trust and feel safe with. i went on a long walk outside, no phone no nothing. and i kept thinking of back when i was a kid. he would not want this for me. i know if i don't kick the hard drugs, it will lead me down a dark hellish path.\n\ni already had a dark childhood. i deserve to have a period in my life where things aren't so bad. but im still struggling. struggling to hold a job, to make and keep friends, to be a person i feel proud of, to make good choices.\n\nim sorry to myself. i want to do better, to be better. i want to have a boyfriend one day and i don't want an open relationship, i wanna be able to cuddle and feel safe with them and play games and help each other grow and put all the casual sex behind me. but i feel i can't pursue a relationship in my current state.\n\nif you read this far thanks i'm sorry that this was so long. this was kind of just me venting. the next few days i know i'm gonna feel weird with the crystal withdrawals. i deleted the app where i met the guy who has it, i pray i have the strength to control myself better in the future.\n\nplease please don't ever try crystal guys. if you haven't, please don't do it. it's true what they say, it only takes one time to become addicted.\n\ni wish anyone else that struggles with any addictions the best of luck, i believe in you. your worth fighting for, please don't give up hope. every day is a new day, a new chance to be a little bit better...",

(20-25bpm higher than normal) i\u2019ve got this strange sense of doom that i continue to feel throughout most of every day, as if something awful is about to happen to me at any moment.\n\ni wonder if these could all be withdrawal symptoms, but i didn\u2019t really use for that long and it\u2019s now been over two weeks. additionally, i\u2019ve maybe only experienced a \u201ccraving\u201d once or twice, and very briefly.\n\ni\u2019m desperate for answers, as the professionals i\u2019ve relied on for them are giving me answers (\u201cyou\u2019re okay\u201d) that totally contradict how i feel. has anyone ever felt how i feel, or how i\u2019m describing? i will absolutely never use cocaine again for as long as i live. i\u2019m incredibly freaked out and even more embarrassed.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(in short, the doctors don't seem to take my pain seriously).\n\ni stopped smoking for 2 non-voluntary periods, the first lasting 9 months (no pain) and the second lasting 7 months (pain). today i want to quit smoking only because of the pain, but not from taking drugs. i have always smoked my drugs and have never taken them in any other form. so i don't know what to take to quit smoking more than it would give me other addictions. \n\ni have a pretty crappy life and being high is the only thing that gives me the strength to get up every morning. i haven't felt the desire to experience this since i was 13 and at 24 today this feeling is even more existent. \nbut i can no longer end my life because i have a child now and besides myself i don't trust any other human to take care of me if i am no more. \ni had a difficult childhood with abuse and i would like to protect this child from this world but i don't have the energy. the very circumstances of his birth are an enigma. \n\ni am writing this with obstructed breathing and pain in my heart and as soon as i publish this text i will go roll a joint. i continue to smoke even more, telling myself that it will eventually kill me with all the warning signals that my body keeps sending me but i don't want to end up in the hospital on life support. \n\nmy only regret will be leaving this innocent being in this cruel world even though i don't want to make him suffer. \nsorry for the length and spelling mistakes just needed to be read.",

        "content": "navigating addiction as a partner i\u2019ve (26f) been with my ex (26m) for 5 years and we broke up last weekend. we own a house together, built a life together, but i found out last weekend that he\u2019s been abusing xanax and did some awful things that i didn\u2019t know he was capable of. he\u2019s getting help to begin to understand his addiction and hasn\u2019t touched the pills in a week. \n\ncoming here for advice really. while in a 4 month spiral he stole from my family, deceived everyone, slept with his ex twice while in a relationship with me, and gambled himself into 34k of debt in a single night. i love him, this is so out of character for him. he\u2019s begging me to stay but he claims to have \u201cblacked out\u201d in a majority of these instances and can\u2019t recall details or the reason why he did these things. candidly, the toughest think for me to get over is the cheating because he ordered my engagement ring last weekend, and in that same day, got high and facetimed his ex for 2 hours in our basement. i believe in him, but is he bs\u2019ing me? can i believe that he simply can\u2019t recall? \n\nwhat hurts the most is that i\u2019m the child of 2 addicts and extremely understanding. i would\u2019ve worked through this with him if he told me, but instead had to find everything out myself so trust is at an all-time low. i\u2019ve been staying at the house to ensure he\u2019s okay because i also found suicide letters he wrote after i found everything out. \n\ni\u2019m not in the headspace to figure \u201cus\u201d out right now. we both need to focus on ourselves, but he\u2019s begging me for another chance. it would take time before i give that a shot but i want opinions from folks who have struggled with something similar.\n\ni apologize if this isn\u2019t the appropriate space to post in and feel free to redirect me.",

        "content": "learned my estranged brother is addicted to something (meth/crack) last night. not sure what i can/should do. for background: my brother (27) and i (30) grew up with our mom and grandparents in the same house where they still live. he was diagnosed with mild tourette's (physical tics and stutter), asthma, and adhd. although we were close as children, he always struggled emotionally. he lacked motivation, performed poorly in school, and prioritized socializing over building his future.\n\nnow, while his high school friends have established careers and families, my brother has descended into dependency and drug addiction. my family enabled him throughout his life. during high school, after a heated argument with our mom where he grabbed a knife (though he didn't use it), she became secretly fearful of him. she even took out a life insurance policy, stating she's more worried about my brother killing her than dying from her health conditions (she's a former smoker and recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes).\n\nas i grew up, i developed resentment toward my brother and family for their enabling behavior. when he went to college, my parents bought him a car, which he totaled within three months while getting a dui. my family would drive four hours round-trip to take him to court-mandated alcohol meetings. after he dropped out, they bought him another car. meanwhile, i was at a school farther away and had to rely on public transportation to get home.\n\nit felt like they coddled him while i had to earn everything. i worked factory jobs during breaks to support myself, while he remained idle at home or socialized, asking our parents for money. he got a girl pregnant, requiring our mom and the girl's parents to arrange an abortion since neither was employed. he once stole my id and money to get into bars underage, initially denying it when confronted.\n\nthis led me to distance myself from my family. i skipped thanksgiving my senior year and reduced visits and calls. i previously had a great relationship with them, but their treatment of him damaged it. they seemed to think that since i was successful on my own, i didn't need support, so they gave him everything. when i expressed my feelings, they dismissed them, saying he needed support while i was fine.\n\nthe last time i felt proud of him was when he joined the army national guard. i was surprised he completed it, but he thrived with structure. during a family visit to his base, he was respectful and seemed genuinely happy.\n\neverything changed during covid. he was stationed in nyc and washington dc during the worst periods, helping with body disposal in mass graves. this experience devastated him. my mom said he wasn't the same when he returned, and everyone noticed. despite his pre-existing psychological issues, this seemed to break him completely. we all tried to help\u2014i reached out, encouraged him to seek help, contacted the va about therapy options\u2014but he refused, insisting he was fine. his drinking increased, he began smoking, and would disappear for days without explanation, all while my family financially supported him through his inability to maintain employment.\n\nlast night, my mother called to tell me my brother has become fully addicted to drugs. he showed up demanding $20, claiming a drug dealer was after him and his girlfriend. when my mom suggested calling the police, he became more agitated. after she threatened to call police herself if he wouldn't leave, he finally departed, but only after suspiciously examining the house. she filed a police report in hopes of getting a restraining order, and no one has heard from him since. my mom is terrified of him now, and is hoping he violates the restraining order so that she can involuntarily get him into a program or facility.\n\nhe's lost over 50 pounds and looks gaunt. he no longer lives at home, and no one knows his current residence. he recently started dating a woman who's also heavily involved with drugs, whom my mom dislikes. he claimed his phone stopped working, so my mom got him a new one; when he said that one failed too, my grandmother gave him her old phone. both phones have disappeared, and my mom suspects he sold them for drugs.\n\ni rarely talk to him anymore\u201490% of his messages were requests for money. i feel guilty for shutting him out when we were younger without explaining why. i simply disliked who he'd become and how my family enabled him. i don't know if i have the right to reach out or help him now. i think about all the times i brushed off his suggestions to hang out, knowing he would drink excessively and expect me to pay (which happened when he visited on my birthday, got drunk, and tried to start a fight).\n\ni'm not sure if i'm posting this just to vent or if i'm seeking advice on what to do. he doesn't have a phone anymore and apparently shares one with his girlfriend. my mom gave me her number, but i haven't contacted her yet. i wouldn't even know what to say.",

        "content": "i think it\u2019s my fault my uncle relapsed hey all, these past 6 months have been really rough for me and i wanted to share my situation and maybe get some advice. this is gonna be long so, just prepare. let\u2019s start from the beginning. 7 months ago, my uncle(25) was a normal functioning human being. he had a good job, he was saving money for a nice car, paying off debts. we all lived together with his parents. it was me, uncle, uncles mom and uncles dad(away most of the time because he works on a ship). he had everything good coming for him. now he has had an extensive history of substance abuse, specifically cocaine. but at the time, he was completely clean and had his life somewhat figured out. during this month, his mother which is my grandmother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and we weren\u2019t sure if she would make it. while she was undergoing treatment, everything went as it should. he\u2019d come home from work, go to the gym, and repeat. we\u2019d even cruise together or go to the mall and walk around. he didn\u2019t have much friends outside of work, but he had a friend that was big on weed. uncle wouldn\u2019t smoke weed, because he thought it was a gateway drug. but sometimes, uncle\u2019s friend would give him weed, and uncle would give it to me. this one time, i rolled it inside of a cigarette uncle was smoking, and i guess i didn\u2019t finish all the weed inside the cig and ended up kinda lacing uncle. this is where i think it begins. he started to be more open to smoking weed, and would smoke it more and more as time went on. a month later, uncle\u2019s mom, (my grandmother) is completely cancer free and in remission. i think this fired something off in his brain where he thought he didn\u2019t have to work so much now, that he could live off his parents like he always did. he quit his job, and then his downfall began. he smoked weed every day and there wasn\u2019t one day where he wouldn\u2019t smoke it. eventually, i find a cocaine baggie on his desk. he starts doing cocaine now, spending every dollar that he was saving for a nice car on cocaine. maybe 2 weeks later, he starts to cook his own crack and smoke it. it would be almost every day he would smoke crack. he also starts to get out of hand at home. he would steal money from his parents, sell power tools or things of value in the house. uncle\u2019s parents would force him to get a job or else they\u2019d kick him out, and he does get one. but he has a process where he\u2019d work a month for one paycheck, then quit the job and spend the entire paycheck on cocaine. then, once he\u2019s out of money he would repeat the process. eventually, his father (who is away almost all the time because he works on the ship) comes home and is sick and tired of his shenanigans and files a restraining order on him. we all live in the same house, so uncle would be homeless. this is where we are now. he sold almost all his possessions like his pc and sound system to buy coke. i got him arrested just a couple hours ago because he came here to the house. sometimes i think to myself and wonder if i hadn\u2019t decided to roll that bit of weed in his cig, this all wouldn\u2019t have happened. it\u2019s just crazy how addiction can turn a good hearted person to a selfish, lazy, person so quickly. i\u2019m only 16, and it\u2019s been mostly me dealing with him because grandma is always at work in the hotel and grandpa is always on the ship. i guess the plan is to keep pushing him to a breaking point until he realizes drugs aren\u2019t getting him anywhere and he quits. but i really don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s how it works.",

        "content": "had one of the most disturbing dreams of my life i had a really disturbing dream last night, and i feel like it carries a strong meaning. it was incredibly violent, vivid, and i felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout.\n\nthe dream:\n\ni was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me, claiming that she had left her jewelry\u2014one necklace and three rings\u2014on my hammock. while i was still half-asleep, i found the jewelry, but she kept grabbing at me, searching for it. i hid the pieces because i wanted to keep them.\n\nlater, i ended up returning only the necklace, which was worthless, at the building\u2019s front desk, but i kept the rings for myself. this threw me into a huge moral dilemma.\n\nthen, i spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery. when i finally went to pick it up, i found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood, his legs completely crushed. cars kept driving over him as if he wasn\u2019t even there. there were two other bodies, crushed beyond recognition, one of them a child.\n\ni was with david (my childhood best friend, a doctor) and sophie (my best friend, one year behind me in med school). david went to help the injured. meanwhile, leo (a former friend i used to do reckless things with) appeared, but he only walked beside me. we greeted each other, exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on, but we didn\u2019t actually talk.\n\nas i walked back to my apartment, still holding the rings in my mouth, i decided to give them to the front desk guy. but when i got there, the usual porter was gone\u2014this one was heavily tattooed, someone i didn\u2019t recognize. instead of taking the jewelry, he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine. he handed the rings back to me.\n\nthen, i got home, and my \u201cfamily\u201d\u2014but it wasn\u2019t my real family, it was the sopranos\u2014walked in. their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry. i put the rings on my fingers.\n\nbut then the old woman appeared again. this time, she confronted me directly and took the rings from me.\n\nthe entire dream was extremely vivid. i felt a crushing sense of guilt, and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifying\u2014i could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain, and i could hear the families crying in the distance.\n\nat some point\u2014either in this dream or another one\u2014i also remember seeing my father. it was from a time before he was bedridden, before everything went downhill. he died when i was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer.\n\n\u2e3b\n\ncontext that might be relevant:\n\n\t\u2022\ti\u2019m a (maybe recovering) polyaddict. i\u2019m like a week totally clean from everything (ketamine and weed), maybe three weeks clean of a mild to moderate opiate habit. coke isn\u2019t really my thing but i had a conversation about my addiction with my roommate and can\u2019t stop reflecting about my use ever since.\n\n\t\u2022\tdavid is my childhood best friend, now a doctor.\n\n\t\u2022\tsophie is my best friend, one year behind me in med school.\n\n\t\u2022\tleo was my main companion for reckless behavior, including drugs. for whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened. for the first time, i\u2019m considering cutting him off completely.\n\n\t\u2022\ti\u2019m currently watching the sopranos.\n\n\n\nthis was one of the heaviest dreams i\u2019ve ever had, and i can\u2019t shake the feeling that it means something important.\n\nimmediately after i woke up i felt the urge to register it. i was calm, just felt like an uncomfortable dream, but as soon as i started reading chatgpt\u2019s output on its meaning i had a legit anxiety attack, i\u2019ve had like 5 legit attacks in my life and this one was textbook. hyperventilation and a physical urge to cry even though i wasn\u2019t feeling really emotional. \n\nthis hit me hard man. it reeks of psychoanalysis so much it\u2019s comical.",

        "content": "smoking/vaping is unfairly demonised when compared to alcohol consumption disclaimer: the smoking i am referring to in this is only nicotine/tabbaco. not weed or anything else you might smoke as i don\u2019t have much experience with those things and so it\u2019s not my place to talk about. \nand also i am mostly talking about short term effects, not long term effects as any addiction has illnesses linked to it to matter what it is (but i do mention it briefly)\n\nso i was thinking about this cuz i\u2019ve had some discussions with my family/friends about their opinions on me smoking/vaping to deal with stress. and i had one conversation with a family member about what is \u201cworse\u201d, drinking or smoking (obviously all addiction is damaging. there is nothing \u201cworse\u201d than another thing. it\u2019s all about what it is and who is doing it)\n\nin my personal opinion the negative effects of smoking and vaping are much less to that of alcohol consumption. and yet it is shunned and demonised more, especially in british culture where drinking is a huge thing. \nboth should be done in moderation. and if used lightly and safely neither are particularly destructive. \n\nboth can be social, or done alone. a social drinker is not much different to a social smoker. you do it around others who are also doing it. \nin both cases this is moderation and yet you\u2019re much more likely to be given a lecture and seen differently about the smoking; despite the fact if you consume too much alcohol you black out, vomit, can become aggressive verbally and physically, and generally speaking pose more of a threat to yourself and others. \nbut if you have too many cigarettes or too many drags of a vape the most that will happen is you might get nic sick, dizzy, or faint. which is easily cured by taking a break and sitting down (as a posed to a night of sleep and then waking up feeling like shit the whole day after)\n\nin terms of public disturbances i also believe that alcohol is the more problematic of the two. drunk driving, vandalism, any form of assault, violence etc. are much more of a disturbance to those around you than smoking and vaping. yes there is a smell lingering after you\u2019ve had a cigarette outside the bar, but this is much easier to ignore than somebody shouting and singing in the street. \n\npersonally, my binge drinking has been much more destructive than my addiction to vaping ever will be. i miss entire nights of my life and ruin fun social gatherings for my friends all because i can\u2019t help just having that last shot. but i have never once forgotten something or caused emotional distress to my loved ones because i vape. \n\nthe lasting effects of long term use for either smoking or alcohol are completely different. and in some cases yes the side effects of 20 years of smoking could be worse than that of 20 years of drinking. but in those 20 years leading up to that, which caused more harm to others and your life. probably the drinking. \non top of this consuming nicotine is not a depressant and can be done during the day to help calm nerves before going back to the task at hand. there is no long lasting effect, and you can return to work, school, or social gathering without disturbing anyone else. it\u2019s ten minute of feeling calmer and refreshed\n\nbasically, i think that it\u2019s unfair that smoking and vaping is so looked down on and shunned when drinking happens in pretty much every home and every gathering all across the world causing many more problems in public and in homes. \nboth should be done in moderation, and neither should be done to cope with mental illness and stress. and when children and poverty is involved both can lead to neglect and abuse, as unfortunately addiction really does take over your life no matter what it is.\n\nlet me know your thoughts, have discussions just be respectful and mindful of what other people may have or are going through. take care of yourselves my lovelys <3\n\n",

i craved it. loved it. hated myself for it. my wife\u2014she\u2019s everything, the only good in me. she doesn\u2019t know. i had a terrible run in with casinos in the past. lost way more than this. almost lost her then\u2014she trusted me again, and i\u2019m shitting on that. hiding this, sneaking around, i\u2019m a coward and a piece of shit. she\u2019s why i\u2019m even here trying to get help\u2014she\u2019s the one lottery i\u2019ve actually won, and i\u2019d gamble my life away without her.  if i told her about this now it would for sure ruin her life and our marriage. \n\nthe $3,500 although it\u2019s a huge sting, i\u2019m lucky that i have a good job and it\u2019s not life changing. if i can stop now, i can move on with my life without much impact. what i\u2019m scared of is it\u2019s been really hard to fucking stop. i said i was going to at 1, 2, 3, now 3.5. for now, i deleted my phantom wallet (the trading platform), deleted x, got all our money into our joint account so that i can\u2019t take any without her seeing. i\u2019m trying to take the right steps. heres the big problem - without the coins, i\u2019m empty\u2014time with her, watching sports, tv, even the dogs i love, it\u2019s all dull. things i use to enjoy, they just aren\u2019t doing it for me. i\u2019m numb, walking dead. this morning, i sat there thinking \u201cwhat if i just wasn\u2019t here?\u201d\u2014haven\u2019t felt that since my last crash years ago. won\u2019t do anything to hurt myself, but it\u2019s in my head, and that\u2019s terrifying. what if i\u2019m stuck like this\u2014half a man, nothing lighting me up?\n\nthe other problem i have is no one knows. there\u2019s no one i trust that i can lean on and tell them. i need someone to hold me to this, an accountability partner\u2014tell me i\u2019m done, check me if i falter. i want your stories\u2014lost big, felt this hollow, how the hell do you climb out? i want to feel happy about regular life again, feel anything. i\u2019m begging here. help me kill this before it kills me.  this has grabbed me harder than any sports bet, horse race, or casino run has in the past and it scares the hell out of me.

        "content": "coming off benzos hi everyone,\n\ni was on 8mg of klonopin prescribed by my pdoc. i moved to a new state about four years ago and was allowed to keep my doctor because he's licensed in all 50 states. then in december, i was told i had to get a new doctor to prescribe my medication because it's a controlled substance and the state laws were aiming on cracking down on out-of-state prescriptions for specifically opiates and benzos. \n\ni tried to go cold turkey and made it about three weeks. the sickest i've ever been. i did find a new doctor after i could take no more and explained what happened. she was willing to continue my medication but at a max 2mg (down from 8mg) per day. she is willing to increase it to 3mg a day at this point. \n\ni'm still on the 2mg for the second month and i feel rotten. not in full-blown withdrawal like i was when i was left with nothing, but still, my quality of life is not good. \n\ni'm wondering what i can do to improve my mental health. we're discussing adding an anti-depressant to help the depression and she already did add ambien for the insomnia. \n\nas far as i know, inpatient programs aren't great for benzos because the withdrawal timelines are long and sometimes protracted/unknown. would a 12 step group help me? would outpatient treatment help? are there any otc things that can make benzo withdrawal feel better?\n\ni so badly want to be benzo free at this point but after 8 years at 8mg a day, i feel like my brain doesn't know how to work without medication anymore and the emotional and physical sickness from withdrawal is so terrifying that i am trying my best to avoid it. and i know \"cold turkey\" is dangerous and that i shouldn't have tried it, but when the state sprung the decision on me, i had no doctor and had to wait to see one, anyway, so i thought it might work, but it failed horribly. \n\ni can make it on 2 a day. a little more comfortably on 3, a little less comfortably on 1. i just want to be able to leave the house and not feel mired in ailments all the time. on 8, i felt pretty good every day, but it was so much that it was allowing me not to have to do the work to feel better, leaving me the way i am now, struggling with the same issues and not having enough medication anymore to make all \"bad feelings\" go away and not even knowing what resources could possibly help me at this point.\n\nso if any of you has struggled with benzo withdrawal or discontinuation and came through okay, please let me know what helped you.

        "content": "masturbation/porn addiction so to get one of the potentially more gross parts out first, i first discovered porn around 6 years old. i\u2019m not misremembering, i have some pretty solid memories of it around that time. my upbringing wasn\u2019t the best, but it wasn\u2019t horrible. my parents have gotten their shit together, and are both very good people. i was not assaulted or groomed. i heard a lot of stuff from rated r movies and adult cartoons like family guy, and then i gained internet access with a computer. at first, it was crazy, as it usually is the first time. the first vid i saw was of a woman touching herself, which probably made me feel more inclined to intimate stuff. guess i got lucky there, since it could\u2019ve been way worse. but when a guy came on and oral stuff happened, i immediately got grossed out and clicked off. there were a couple more disturbing things on sites like omegle that happened years later, but i guess i smartened up(chickened out) and got off of it.\n\nso yeah, that\u2019s how it started for the most part. i\u2019m now legally an adult, and i\u2019ve been doing this for most of my life. it\u2019s usually like 2 times a day, at least. sometimes much more. i\u2019ve tried to go cold turkey several times before, but that obviously didn\u2019t work out, as my hormones were going crazy and we were in quarantine. i\u2019ve got like over 16k favorites on just one \u201cmanga\u201d site alone, if that shows how bad the consumption is. it\u2019s still significantly worse than that, too.\n\ni usually do it to relieve stress or when i\u2019m bored. i imagine that\u2019s pretty common, though. when i have something i\u2019m doing, i don\u2019t even think about it. but then when i notice that, and feel proud of myself, my mind acts like a chainsaw with a ball of yarn. not just for this, but for a lot of stuff. if i catch a bit of it, the rest ends up following, and the source of my short-lived pride  crumbles and i say a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nthankfully, i\u2019ve never really hurt anyone with anything related to this, and i don\u2019t have any desire to do so. it most definitely altered the way i viewed women when i was younger, but luckily for me, i never got lucky with romance. hopefully i get lucky from now on, though. plus, i\u2019m not as much of a shithead.\n\ni feel like the one of the biggest factors is how much free time i have. but even when i find something more productive to do, if i get stressed out, it\u2019s one of the first things i go to. touching myself has even become kinda instinctive to deal with anger, and it affected my grades a bit during school. being more productive is definitely going to be much better than 100% abstaining very suddenly, but it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s going to be some sort of rebound or something.\n\ni mean, i guess i\u2019m looking to vent this somewhere? i don\u2019t have anyone to tell this to in person. but some advice would be nice. i think i\u2019m quite fucked, honestly. thanks in advance. have a good day.",

        "content": "question to all the men trying to quit p hey guys,\n\n*this post was approved by mods.*\n\nto be most upfront: i need your honest opinion for an app idea i have. be ruthless, but be kind.\n\ni've struggled with p addiction for quite some time in my life (starting at around 14 until around 28 - i'm 33 now).\n\nafter years of relapsing, discovering myself and increasing self-awareness enough \u2013 to the point where i was eventually able to understand why i was addicted in the first place \u2013 i was able to quit.\n\nunfortunately, this filth has never really left my life.\n\nin the sense that social media is full of it and even in my friend group guys are talking about them struggling too. and the amount of people online talking about having issues with it is just astounding.\n\nthat being said:\n\nthere are sh!t ton of apps that aim at helping you quit, but i figured many of these just do the same stuff (some quotes, streak counter, badges, accountability that works more or less well) which more often than not hinders your ability to quit bc you eventually feel even more shame for breaking streak etc.\n\nbut not many apps dive into the real underlying issues\n\n- psychological triggers\n\n- dopamine addiction\n\n- emotional reasons\n\nand tbh, often times they're just boring to use (bad ux, no gamification).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nlately i've decided to pursue my lifelong dream of learning how to program and i thought what better way to do it than to actually build something that helps other people.\n\nsince watching porn usually comes with a boat load of shame around it, i was thinking about what would happen if you could actually make a game out of quitting.\n\nso, the idea is to build an rpg-game like app where people can choose different classes like warrior, mage, rogue etc that tailors to their personal preference and whenever the urges hit, they will be tasked with quests (e.g. warrior -> do 10 push ups etc), they can level the character, perform side quests and so on (think of the app finch but for quitting p)\n\nand for those of you who have quit or are trying to quit, you know this:\n\nquitting will do jack shit for you if you don't replace the free time and energy with something that actually makes your life better.\n\nnow, obviously there's a lot more that goes into it, but the app would actually solve three problems:\n\n- quit p\n\n- become a better human along the way by building habits\n\n- increase self awareness and emotional resilience along the way\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nso, i guess the question is:\n\nwould you guys actually use something like this?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nps:\nfor those of you who wonder if this will be free.\n\nat this point it's not about monetization.\n\nalthough i would probably go for a freemium model with ads + low cost sub ~ $2-3 monthly for additional features like real time community features to cover the server costs etc) to give as much access as possible to as many people as possible.",

        "content": "i don't feel good anymore. i need help but don't know how to take it. it started with weed, the first mistake i made was be the guy in the group who knows where to get the good stuff because i didn't have supervision at home. i could smoke weed at home cool right? so i thought until i realised i'm addicted to weed. then it was cigarettes after that my first boss at a petstore made me try some coke at 18. that went on every time i'd get paid or extra money i'd think of doing coke since she stopped giving me coke for free. so i stopped because i literally could not afford it i knew this time i was addicted but i blamed my environment, i didn't go to college but started a job where every smoked weed all the time, before shift, during shift,after shift and then again at home. i told people it's all organic don't panic it helps me sleep i was the guy who thought i am this. like being a druggie is a personality and anyone who judges me doesn't know me. my first relationship ended because she wanted me to quit and instead she started smoking weed as well. eventually blamed me and left. but i had stopped coke which is great. but moved to different city and unfortunately my boss put me up in a hotel where the manager dealt drugs and they literally had. trip room. at first i again excused myself by saying you attract your tribe here i had chance for fresh start but started using mdma or maybe it was bath salts who knows it felt good kept me dancing in the club lost weight had glow from doing it on the weekend to doing a 14 day streak was snorting just to work again at first i said to myself it's helping me i'm happy every one's happy but i was not and in debt for the first time. i moved away from the hotel after a year the damage was done i tried stopping but just needed a push to use again decided i need to leave the city and go back home atleast i don't know anyone there who doesn't anything it's all about your environment i said.\nbut then on new year's i met my mentor who got a contact of coke dealer i knew then in the back of mind this is bad idea. instead i said let's goo!!! and give me his no. now with adult money not much but enough to by 2-3 grams i became his best customer without my mentor knowing know one knows i'm so addicted i do it many times in a month i win bets instead of paying my debts i do coke and take on more debt it's was fun before now i just do it alone silently with something on the tv. i'm going to lose my job because i didn't show up most of the times on the night i am using i think they know as well. i feel things are going to go really bad for me they aren't yet but i am scared of addiction this person writing this and the person sober tomorrow feel different and don't like each other. i sober up sometimes but come back stronger. now my nose bleed after every use still i google alternate ways to do coke. i remember we shared a bad between us 2 now sometime 4bags are enough for me alone it's literally as much as gold per gram if spent that money on my future my mom would be so proud but her son's an addict and i dont know how to stop because i've even forgotten when was the last time i promised myself this will be my last time i've just accepted some people like are born to rot. it's funny how first getting high made me optimistic now it just make me feel like being your own villian in a story.",

        "content": "my \u201caddiction\u201d to weed, was it real? (15f) i have recently quit smoking weed due to the effects of it on my life and my mental health. i do, do it every now and then at night. but i believe i did struggle with addiction, but i feel like it isn\u2019t as validated considering it isn\u2019t a drug like heroine or cocaine. in late september early october i started smoking carts and fell into a hole. my depression came, and when it did, i\u2019d use the high to clear it out. for months i would constantly get high at school and then sleep for hours when i\u2019d get home. i was under constant stress and it was a routine to just go to school and use my cart every day 1st period. it was just a common day-to-day thing in my life and without it i felt like i was nothing. the high stopped getting fun in early january when i switched from muha to boutiqs and everything went downhill from there. i would constantly zone out and start losing physical consciousness in class, (if that makes sense) and i would never just feel high like a rush, my perception of time was completely altered (ex. a week would feel like a day to me), my memory was so poor, i wouldn\u2019t be able to remember any dinners i\u2019ve eaten within the past few days and i\u2019d constantly forget things said to me, or things i\u2019ve said moments before and much more. all in all it\u2019d just feel like i was retarded. and as wrong as it sounds, that\u2019s literally how it felt. my grades obviously declined and i became a zombie. and it doesn\u2019t sound that bad, but it was most definitely the worst 5-6 months of my life. late february, the i started to realize the highs became so miserable for me and i thought it was just me having too high of a tolerance so i finally decided to put it down with intentions to quit for around a week to a month for a t-break. first day off it felt like a breath of fresh air being sober for a full day and almost a week in it\u2019s so hard to imagine how i lived life like i did and be, somewhat, content with my life. i think me being like that every day changed my perspective on how your mindset should be on your average day to day, which caused me to think that the way i was living was completely normal and that i was just high like everybody else. is addiction to weed real? and should it be less validated because of the fact it\u2019s a more common substance and people do it all the time?",

(let\u2019s just call him alex) and it started great. he\u2019s a really cool and fun person, the excting life he lived was really attractive to me(skydiving,motorcycles,martial arts). and i was i guess you can say blinded by my crush on him too much to notice at first. but as we progressed and i came over more, his family got really comfortable around me\u2026 and out of nowhere started pulling out bags and vacuuming them down right in front of me. knowing i\u2019m strictly sober. the thing is it was weird, but i can\u2019t control u. it started out just making me uncomfortable but then i realized all the signs, and started to realize how much they did. they did \u2744\ufe0feveryday non stop morning to midnight. he started getting moody with me and paranoid and upset all the time. i want to help and he has gotten a lot better especially after he realized he has a problem. but its a constant loop of falling back into it. he will stop for a week or 2 but then relapse because his family all does it. he doesn\u2019t do what he used to do and be the fun guy i fell for, and im thinking, how can i not only help him recover, but make it so he helps his family recover? because they do everything with him, he won\u2019t go skydiving unless his brother and dad come along. he won\u2019t go on a ride bc it\u2019s too cold but i know if he had someone asking to ride with him he would get on his motorcycle in less than a minute. it just makes me sad watching them crumble into this state of mind, all depressed 24/7.",

        "content": "managed my first day on just benzos since being homeless in temporary accommodation nearly 3 weeks back i became homeless, i had a suicide attempt and my family found out about my drug use. they were willing to let me stay at home but social services said i had to leave because i've got younger siblings (only ever used at night when they were asleep or when i was away from home, made sure to keep my drugs inaccessible to them and stay in my room so they would never see me high, i love my siblings and would never knowingly risk them witnessing me high or getting access to my drugs). literally the day after i got discharged from hospital, i was kicked out. spent the weekend in a hotel and on the monday i got put in temporary accommodation. \n\nthe thing is i've never been alone like that. i'm 20 and have always lived with my family. when i wasn't at theirs, i was either in psych wards when i was in my mid teens or over the last half year i've stayed at my mates house a lot. but i've never been alone. i'm autistic and have various other mental illnesses so i really don't do well in new places especially not alone. i managed in the hotel because i had my therapy cat with me and had to stay alert and be there for him. but completely alone in temporary accommodation (they don't allow pets) i've not coped. every night i've been there i've been getting as high as i could. benzos daily (i'm physically dependent on benzos so i can't not take them) with opiates or ket or dxm or whatever i can find to get me messed up. the only times i've managed on just a low benzo dose have been the nights i've been allowed to stay at home with my cat which i've only had a few of those nights so far, they've only been allowed as of recently because of how much i'm struggling to cope and how bad my mental state got. the agreement is i'm allowed 1-2 nights a week at home on the conditions that i only use my anti withdrawal benzo dose alone in my room at night, don't come home high and don't bring drugs with me aside from obviously the one dose of benzos. \n\nwednesday night i wanted to try my first night in that place on nothing but my non withdrawal dose of benzos (two bars, doesn't get me high but stops me from wd). ended up in hospital needing stitches for self injury and did ket in the a&e bathroom. failed. but thursday night i actually did it. granted, a higher dose of benzos than normal but i did a night non benzo sober. i had access to multiple other drugs but i didn't touch them.\n\nit doesn't seem like much of an achievement when i'm still using benzos every day, especially not when i used a higher dose than my anti wd so i did still get a high but for me it's a step in the right direction. and i'm going to keep trying over time to manage more and more nights in that place on just the benzos, hopefully in lower doses as time goes on. \n\nmight not be able to get completely sober yet but i'm going to try and put the work in to reduce how much i'm using and reduce how often i'm mixing potentially dangerous and fatal drugs. i want to get better and i'm going to keep putting the effort in until i get a space in detox and rehab. hopefully by then i'll have reduced even more.

        "content": "delusions of grandeur: reading this will make you see how crazy you arent. i understand finding a higher power is the key most have found to solving the disease of the mind we call addiction. \ni have developed a pretty bulletproof holier than thou complex, and being so aware yet still choosing to feel my loops of thought and hatred all the more frustrating. \nat times i feel like i am going insane, i have thoughts of \u201cthese people arent like me\u201d and somehow i am better and more aware than they are. i used to tell myself im humble but im starting to believe appearing as a humble person to others was the only reason i wanted to be so humble and self aware. \nwhat i struggle with is thinking. every second of every day i think. theres a little voice in my head telling me how to act, what to think, and how to make situations go my way. in truth i see myself as some sort of master manipulator and have become prideful of that discusting \u201cfact\u201d. \n\u201ci went to rehab and all i got was this lousy tee shirt\u201d \nrehab made me realise im not alone, but that feeling of normality and saneness can only come from me truly believing it, and practicing \u201cself love\u201d i suppose is the term. \ni think about what i am thinking, i disect everything that voice in my head says just to try to answer questions i know i cant solve. i need more people around me to feel comfortable, i am truthfully a social person. but the voice comes back. is it all just a manipulative plot i create and dont even realise? am i even real anymore? how do i get over this when people that talk this way are considered crazy. people seem to care when its convenient for them. so i should start caring about myself without reling on the attention of others so often. but yet i continue to snort cocaine and lose my shit. im delusional and self aware of the delusions which causes me to create more delusions in my head to feel normal. self pity and selfish ways for what? i have such love for other people yet only seem to care about how they make me feel. even going out of my way to \u201chelp\u201d others just to feel like more of a god. im starting to think im losing it or everyone else is. im not crazy you are type stuff. back to rehab seems to be the only option. back to the cult of god and loving eachother. i really love it but despise my reliance on it. a fellowship of people like me. i love me so i love people i see myself in. so fucking gross. me me me all day. even typing this long ass message is just a way for me to keep myself in the loop of me. shit is pathetic. self pity gotta love it. this shit is so lame idk if anyone is reading this but if someone is and is struggling too, you arent crazy. you just keep being so disrespectful and hard on yourself that you are losing your grip on who you are. and drugs are only going to add to the delusion of control over these thoughts. shit is the devil man. real shi",

        "content": "today i accepted the fact that i am addicted to cocaine, and i fucking hate myself. this is gonna be a long post. i have literally nowhere else to put my words though, none of my family or friends (besides the 1 friend who has occasionally done it with me, but to their knowledge does not know that i do it on my own constantly) know that i do cocaine almost daily and it is eating me alive.\n\nit started out how it \u2018usually does\u2019 - few bumps maybe every couple of months or longer during special occasions, then a couple of months turned into every other weekend, especially when drinks were involved, to every other day after i got robbed in a city i\u2019ve never been in before that set me off into the worst bipolar depressive episode i have ever had. \n\ni was doing so fucking good before too. i had all of my bipolar meds that kept me steady, i became addicted to the gym and working out daily for hours straight, rarely drank alcohol - i looked fucking great too (because i was healthy lol) then i decided to go to a music festival in a city 8 hours away that i have never been to before; my first solo trip\u2026 and then i got fucking robbed. all of my id\u2019s stolen (which sucked immensely because i drove there so the drive home was risky) and my credit card as well. i slept in a denny\u2019s parking lot for 3 hours to sober up off the few drinks i had in the festival and then drove home sobbing and feeling like a complete idiot. \n\ni don\u2019t even really think it was the whole robbed thing that set off this horrid episode because when you have bipolar, you know that what goes up absolutely comes crashing fucking down. i knew i was gonna crash, this robbing situation just accelerated it. \n\ni got super fucking depressed and suicidal, had an attempt on my own goddamn bipolar medications - which led the hospital to completely cold turkey me off of every single one without the help of a psychiatrist (as he was on vacation during the time lol). to cold turkey off of fucking anything that changes your brain\u2019s chemicals is absolutely ass, i have absolutely never felt this way in my entire life. i literally feel like my soul left that day but my body is still here. time doesn\u2019t feel real - it\u2019s monday and then i lay in bed all day and suddenly it\u2019s 3 fucking mondays later. literally everything is out of wack in my system, still. this robbing incident took place in july, it\u2019s 8 months later and i\u2019m still in this fucking depressive episode and on top of it, i forced my own self to confess that i have a pathetic issue with cocaine. \n\ni had enrolled in college and started in the end of september, but by this point i was so fucked up from the cold turkey meds situation that sleep was nonexistent to the point i was seeing shit and became super paranoid. i could barely wake up everyday for my 9 am classes and even when i did, i would fall asleep during the entire class (can sleep anywhere else but in my own bed when i\u2019m supposed to, i guess?) so i bought a bag of cocaine.\n\nat first it was great, i was able to go to class alert and actually participate in my course discussions, i didn\u2019t feel so much anxiety while socializing in my class, and it didn\u2019t matter if i was running on no sleep - i was awake. \u2018i\u2019 was in control of myself for the first time in months - no longer wasting the day in bed not knowing what time or actual day it was being a complete hermit. i was actually able to function. but then of course, it started to suck. obviously coke fucks with your sleep and i already wasn\u2019t sleeping, so i found myself bumping lines at 7 am daily (even if there wasn\u2019t class, just so i could get that alert, non-depressive fatigue feeling and clean my house fully, go to the grocery store, etc) all the way until 7 am the next day. \n\n*it has been 6 months of this and i completely fucking hate myself.*\n\ni don\u2019t do it every single day, sometimes 2 days in a row, pause for 1 and then back again or 3 days without any and then the rest of the week i am a coked out loser. \n\ni am a very functional addict but obviously everyone could see a change in me, essentially rapid cycling through different emotions every single day (really depressed and quiet to happy and outgoing) but for the last few months, i haven\u2019t been able to get that outgoing happy feeling from it, i just feel sad and anxious and i keep thinking of how fucking stupid i am. and how gross coke is. and how i am a \u2018coke head\u2019. \n\ni\u2019m hermit-ting again and everyone notices but they just assume it is my bipolar. i just don\u2019t feel like myself enough to be around everyone else. i haven\u2019t felt like myself in 8 months. it has actually been really interesting because throughout the period of doing coke constantly, i have noticed changes in myself behaviour and appearance wise and have thought of myself as some sort of fucked up science experiment. i have actually really fucked up my health too, which continuously weighs on me because there is nothing and nobody else to blame it on but me, because i do a very gross and depressing habit. i hate myself. i hate myself so fucking much. i hate that i\u2019m too ashamed of myself to be around anyone because of my actions yet *why haven\u2019t i stopped then?* because you are a fucking addict. i hate that i\u2019ve been missing appointments and repeatedly having to do apology tours and lie about being really sick as the reason for missing them, when really i missed those appointments because i stayed up for 13 hours straight with my nose in a bag and then needed to sleep, thus missing the appointment. i hate how i fucking look, my hair is thin and sad looking and my skin that was once a beautiful deep tan olive tone has turned grey and dry - *dead looking*. i hate how i feel every time i wake up the next day with a stuffed up nose. i hate thinking about how much of a fucking pathetic loser i was the night before when looking for cocaine remnants in my carpet - like holy fuck, what is wrong with you???\n\nit sucks because i am so hyper aware of what i am doing to myself and i just sit there and crush myself over and over again, only to do the same thing the next day and then mentally berate myself for being an absolute moron. the concept of it is so simple, just stop doing cocaine - yet it is so confusing because i actually don\u2019t even know why i keep doing it.\n\ni do not get withdrawal symptoms, granted i only give myself a week of a break off of the drug, but i do not have any *physical* addiction symptoms, just mental. if that even makes sense. i can go days without it, but the moment i see it in a tv show, or see a meme about drugs, then i want to do it and i do it. maybe that is physically addicted, i don\u2019t know. probably. it\u2019s just that i have no fucking reason to actually do it, physical-ly wise. yes i am really, really sad but i don\u2019t need it and i know that. \n\ntoday i have decided this is where this fucking ends because for 6 months i have not been alive. i plan on going back to the gym and dedicating my time to that, no longer going out or drinking alcohol since that seems to always lead to one thing to the next, focusing on school, taking care of myself because i have severally neglected myself during these few months, and just being a normal fucking human being again. \n\ni just hate this shame and guilt that i constantly have and it\u2019s not coming from anyone else but myself and i think that is almost worse. i am keeping my own deepest darkest secret that is destroying me. i am so ashamed, disappointed, angry, and saddened by myself. why do i hate myself so much and feel so much pain that this is what i have done to myself? \n\nfuck cocaine. fuck being a zombie. today i am sober and i plan on living my life out that way. \n\n",

        "content": "no withdrawal symptoms from using benzos and kratom for years. to start off i\u2019m bipolar and have been on the same regimen of 20mg olanzapine, 30 mg mirtazipine, and 200 mg of lamactil for about 2-3 years. \n\ni was/am and alcoholic for years and physically dependent on it for a couple years (thanks pandemic). i was drinking so much because\ni live in new orleans and drinking is ingrained in social society , like having a liquor store at every corner store. i learned later that i was drinking to combat my undiagnosed manic phases of bipolar. \n\nnow that caused me to go into some serious withdrawal symptoms for days. i had like 4 .5 kolonopin to \u201chelp\u201d but that didn\u2019t do anything. auditory hallucinations, puking from anxiety every 10 minutes, sweating, shaking and didn\u2019t get out of bed for 3 days other than to pee and drink water. it led me into a deep depression for 2 weeks that i eventually on my own got through it. i\u2019m about 5-6 (i don\u2019t count) years sober now without anything like aa, just my personal support system \n\nmy intake doctor described what i have is cbt resistant anxiety. im in exposure therapy because it was one of the last techniques we haven\u2019t used. anxiety has affected every aspect of my life pretty much with strong physical and mental symptoms that has limited my work, sexually, and social limitations among other things. \n\nim in therapy half to convince my doctor im proactively trying to control my anxiety and as an experiment for myself to see if i can actually reduce my anxiety.\n\n  i\u2019m prescribed 10 1mg kolonopin every month and a half. \n\ni used kratom heavily (about 10-15) grams everyday for over a year and half with the only \u201clooking tired\u201d as a symptom. \n\ni\u2019ve been using xanax on and off since i was 19. on a regular basis i get 14 2mg xanax for about 3 years. i was taking.5 mg-1mg a day then  i realized that xanax wasn\u2019t the cure for my anxiety the way i needed it, it didn\u2019t last long and just didn\u2019t work like kolonopin. i\u2019ve been taking 1 to 2mg of kolonopin for months now sometimes with .5 mg of xanax depending on the situation and levels of anxiety or if on the verge of a panic attack. \n\nive been using recreational drugs since i\nwas 14: mdma, mda, mushrooms, adderall and cocaine( 1 gram every 3-4 months) i tend to stay away from\ncocaine because it\u2019s expensive at the end feel like shit. after i take my medication and sleep i feel fine. not lsd anymore because of the olanzapine:-// \n\ni\u2019ve heard horror stories of serious kratom withdrawal so i decided to see what happens when i quit. nothing happened for days and that turned into weeks of just feeling perfectly fine. i now use it almost daily again but just less because i don\u2019t want to abuse it heavily as in the past. (haven\u2019t taken it in a week as of today)\n\ni\u2019ve done a lot research on benzo withdrawal ranging from asking friends, reddit, doctors, nurses. some people are on low doses for a month and go into withdrawal, i have a friend who was taking 2, 2mg everyday for almost 10 years and one day decided to quit. no symptoms, i thought that was crazy. \n\nfor the past few months of taking kolonopin my daily anxiety has gone down and i go days without taking any kind of benzo. daily levels of anxiety have gone down and general feelings of \u201ci can do this\u201d and i just don\u2019t take anything except a bit of kratom or other recreational drugs. if i feel fine i just roll with it and have accepted that i have good and bad days that are sometimes in my control and sometimes in my irrational brains control. usually during those days i sometimes do kratom because i like the way it feels and calms me down.\n\nmy question is why haven\u2019t i developed any physical or mental symptoms to benzo or kratom withdrawal ? i\u2019ve already gone through a serious withdrawal so i known what that\u2019s like and don\u2019t want to happen again. is my technique of just switching the drugs i do every couple of days saving me from withdrawal? is my medication saving me? is it the strong willpower that i developed from being an alcoholic helping me? \nor just one day i will become physically addicted? from my previous experience that takes time and different levels of abuse. the levels of \u201cabuse\u201d that i\u2019m doing in my opinion isn\u2019t a serious problem. \n\nif i told my doctor or therapist these things, i\u2019ve been told by my primary care (all under the same clinic) that i will be dropped as a patient and in my case without insurance is not an option. so i appreciate the answers, questions\nand comments.",

        "content": "my (18f) boyfriend (19m) just admitted to a serious addiction i don\u2019t even know how to process this fully. my boyfriend recently admitted that he\u2019s deep into drugs\u2014specifically, he\u2019s been abusing his medication for awhile now and just a few hours ago told me. he\u2019s supposed to take 1-3 pills of 300mg, but instead, he\u2019s been taking sixteen 100mg pills at a time. he ran out of his prescription a week early and has been experiencing intense withdrawal symptoms, which are similar to panic attacks.\n\nthe hardest part? he\u2019s been terrified to tell me. he called it his \u201cred flag secret\u201d and assumed i would leave him over it. i think part of that fear came from an early conversation we had where i told him i don\u2019t like drugs or smoking because addiction is a huge fear of mine\u2014i\u2019ve seen it destroy people in my family. but i\u2019m not leaving him. if anything, this just makes me want to support him even more.\n\nthe thing is\u2026 he doesn\u2019t want help. or rather, he refuses to see himself as someone who needs it. he\u2019s incredibly stubborn and has a lot of that \u201ci don\u2019t want to be weak\u201d mindset. he wants to handle this on his own, but at the same time, i can tell how much this is scaring him. he\u2019s having multiple withdrawal episodes a day, and even his mom is catching on\u2014she actually hid two jars of pills from him before recently giving them back.\n\nhis best friend, who finally noticed, is the reason he told me at all. my boyfriend was really upset about that, i think because it meant his struggle was visible now. he told me, \u201ci probably can only tell you this cause i\u2019m high out of my mind now\u2026i only realized that i needed to tell you after [best friend\u2019s name] called me out on it.\u201d mind you, this hit hard because early into our relationship, he mentioned that he was paranoid i\u2019d find out his \u201cred flag.\u201d that statement made me hyperaware, and i spent so much time trying to figure out what it was\u2014only for it to finally come out like this. i understood that trust, specifically his, was earned over a long period of time. it hurt that he didn\u2019t talk before hand but i also understood in my own way the fear, shame, and pain of an addiction. it\u2019s\u2026.hard. especially cause you dont want to be defined by it.\n\nwhen he told me, he was crying, ashamed, and paranoid. he even apologized for lying to me, even though looking back, i don\u2019t think he actually lied\u2014i think he was just panicking. in that moment, i didn\u2019t know what the \u201cright\u201d response was. should i focus on physically comforting him and making sure he knew nothing had changed? should i have acknowledged the hurt from realizing how deep this went\u2014how he had taken two full days\u2019 worth of pills right before seeing me- probably in order to even come close to telling me this? was he expecting some other reaction from me entirely?\n\ni ended up doing all 3 but internalized the last one though i did send two follow up reassurance messages for him to process when somewhat more sober.\n\ni didn\u2019t know how to verbally communicate , so i spoke from my heart:\n\n\t\u201cthank you for telling me. you\u2019re not defined by addiction, you\u2019re just struggling. it\u2019s *human* to struggle. im not expecting perfection if you yourself accept my imperfections. i hope i can ease your fears over time and my support will never fade over time- i\u2019m avaliable over text, call, hanging out, etc. i\u2019m here and staying. so whenever you\u2019re ready i\u2019ll be there but i\u2019m not babying or defining the relationship around this, cause i know you want to work on this alone. it\u2019s hard, but you\u2019re more than this, you\u2019ve always been and that\u2019s why i\u2019m staying.\u201d\n\ni don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s arrogant or all of it because i was trying to respected his need for self sufficiency (i think that\u2019s the right word). he grew up in a religious-military-dominant family that tried to \u2018fix\u2019 him rather than \u2018help\u2019 him- so obviously why would i expect him to want to hear \u2018oh yes let\u2019s help you\u2019 when he\u2019s lived his whole life defined by that. i know he loves his family through this though it\u2019s messed with a perspective that\u2019ll take time to trust ... \n\ni directly and verbally told him as well that i wasn\u2019t expecting him to rely on me, but i was still by his side if he ever needed me. i gave him big hugs when i could see he was comfortable and squeezed his hand to help him know i was still listening and loving.\n\nbefore i left, he showed me his scars\u2014ones he had never shown anyone else. he asked me if he was a bad person because of it. i turned it around and asked, \u201cam i a bad person for what i did to survive?\u201d he said no. so i asked why i would think he was any different. he laughed and i let him relax into me.\n\ni told him i loved him. i told him he was beautiful and handsome. i reminded him of the difference between struggling and being someone to run from. i reminded him that i saw his value and was so proud of him even through this, cause it\u2019s hard to survive much less be stable.\n\nnow i\u2019m just sitting here crying tho, trying to process. i don\u2019t know what to do next (i started crying because it just all hit me at once. he\u2019s dealing with horrible withdrawal, but i don\u2019t know how to support him when he refuses to accept help. his best friend is worried. his mom knows something is up. and i feel like i\u2019m just watching this unfold with no solutions.\n\nany advice would mean the world right now.",

i needed breathing room, and now the entire relationship\u2019s fate is my burden? it feels like another way she dodges accountability.\n\nlast night, she said she\u2019d call me to talk things out, but it\u2019s been almost 24 hours, and i haven\u2019t heard from her. this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s promised to connect and then gone silent, leaving me waiting and unsure. i haven\u2019t texted her because i feel like if she cared, she\u2019d reach out. but maybe i\u2019m overanalyzing.\n\nwhere i\u2019m at now:\n\n\t\u2022\ti love her and have poured so much into this relationship. walking away feels like letting go of something i\u2019ve worked hard to build.\n\t\u2022\tbut i\u2019m exhausted. i feel like i\u2019m the only one trying to address the deeper issues, even though she does call sometimes, and i know she cares about me.\n\t\u2022\tthe trust issues from her past and her current emotional distance are weighing on me, and i\u2019m not sure she fully understands how they\u2019re affecting our connection.\n\t\u2022\ti\u2019m unsure if she\u2019s as committed to working through this as i am, and i\u2019m struggling to figure out how to move forward.\n\nso, reddit, what are some ways i can approach this situation?i\u2019m torn between reaching out again and giving her space to reconnect on her own. i don\u2019t want to regret my decision, but i also don\u2019t want to keep carrying the relationship alone. what strategies or perspectives can help me navigate this? any advice is appreciated.\n\ntl;dr: as a 28m in a 10-month relationship with my 27f girlfriend, her history of lying, emotional distance, and past infidelity has created trust issues for me, and i know she\u2019s struggling with overstimulation, cravings, and flashbacks. i feel like i\u2019m the only one fighting for our relationship, and when i express my hurt, she accuses me of guilting her. we\u2019re on a \u201cbreak\u201d i initiated, but she\u2019s left fixing it entirely up to me. she promised to call last night but didn\u2019t, and this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s gone silent after promising to connect. i\u2019m looking for advice on how to approach this moving forward.",

(which regulated my use of social media, but from urges i would not always block certain apps which allowed me to watch porn.) this would only leave me with a phone with access to porn, books and my laptop for the occasional yt binge. the last 2 years of hs were very stressful for me due to academic and other personal stresses. this made me wanting to watch more porn aswell. it was only a few days ago i realised that i am addicted to porn, when i would watch porn a day before my final exams when my curriculum wasn't finished. i was using it to escape my anxiety and stress. \n\nnow i wonder wheather i was wrong by making myself separate from my hobbies and essentially caused my porn addiction. and if that is the case, what steps should i take to help myself go back to the normal me who watched porn occasionally whenever my body would want to rather than as a way to cope with my stress. \n\n(i do use an app on my phone to block apps i use for porn but my fucking nerd brain always finds a way to watch porn in some way shape or form. i swear if i used that much brain power in my homework and shit, my academics would be in a slightly better place than it is in right now lol)\n\nthank u for reading my stuff, and i am eternally grateful to anyone who takes some of their time to help me out.\n\ntldr: want to know if i am addicted because of my lack of hobbies or not, and if i am because of that, then i would like some advice on how to deal with it.\n\n",

        "content": "my oxycodone story this is my through away account, i posted here maybe a year ago? i started using oxycodone in 2020 for stress relief and psychological abuse from my partner. when i found out she had been having an affair for at least 6 months and gaslighted me into thinking i was a controlling and insecure person i kicked her out but also completely crumbled. this was in the summer of 2022. \n\nmy mom, the most supporting person in my life, my rock, my role model passed away suddenly about 8 months later. i was completely devastated and started using more oxycodone and more alcohol. i felt so shit, like a shell of myself and no one knew about the stuff i put in my body. every other week, when i had my daughter i focused on her and that helped me a lot. i still used while i was having her around and sort of justified it to myself by thinking that i was a better father because of the effects of the oxycodone or alcohol. i thought i had more energy and a more functioning dad. now looking back i can see how fucked up that way of thinking was. i probably knew it then and there too but i just couldn\u2019t stop. \n\ni posted here about a year ago. i then quit cold turkey and it was hard. during the same period i also found another job in psychiatric outpatient care with no access to pills. it also probably helped alot that i contacted a doctor and was at home on sick leave for the last few months of my old workplace. that caused me not to be able to get more drugs. \n\ni discovered due to blood tests that my liver was taking damage because of my pill and alcohol use. that was a wake up call too and helped me get motivated to clean myself up due to fear. being educated in the medical field i knew what lied ahead if i didn\u2019t change. i wanted to be there for my daughter, and i didn\u2019t want to die too young, causing my daughter to lose her dad early in life. \n\n\nfast forward until know. i haven\u2019t had any oxycodone since that day, apart from one time when i broke my ribs in an accident and got it from the e.r. it was nice and all to feel that feeling again but after a few days i started having shitty side effects and felt lots of fear and shame so it was actually surprisingly easy not to miss it when i was out of the pills.\n\ni\u2019m still a bit depressed, i struggle with anxiety and shame now and then but i manage it without drugs. i still feel alone due to losing so much from my \u201dold\u201d life but i\u2019m also really proud to be where i am now. i still drink from time to time but it\u2019s not in the same way as before, it\u2019s not about relieving pain. my liver has recovered and i\u2019m feeling more healthy than i\u2019ve done in a long time. \n\ni still haven\u2019t told anyone i know about my use of oxycodone or the extent of my alcohol use. that\u2019s why i post here. hope everyone reading this can find the motivation to quit. the drugs really are not worth it. \n\nin a couple of weeks i celebrate my 34th birthday and i hope i manage to keep making positive choices in life and even though the world seems to be going to shit, at least i am not.

        "content": "thoughts on gabor mate on theo von highly recommend this podcast. for those who haven\u2019t already read it, i also highly recommend gabor\u2019s book in the real of hungry ghosts.\n\nbut i had a question arise from the podcast. gabor goes into detail about two common types of addiction.\n\nfirstly, many stimulant addictions are based around dopamine (pornography addiction also). we become addicted to the hit of dopamine, responsible for motivation and reward, which makes us feel \u201cvital and alive\u201d. this may result from types of childhood trauma that caused us to disconnect from ourselves - from our feelings, experiences and our body. overly-stressed parents not attending to children, children repressed instead of validated, and even physical/sexual abuse. adhd is typically linked to this type of trauma, and often self medicated with these types of drugs. \n\nsecondly, opiate addictions. gabor states that those who become addicted to opiates will commonly have childhood trauma\u2019s based in rejection, unmet emotional needs, insecure interpersonal attachments. they were children who did not feel love - who felt it wasn\u2019t safe to feel love - and are now adults who can\u2019t. the opiate receptors in the brain, which are responsible for the endorphins allowing us to feel love, are now hijacked by opiates from the external world - whether the opium poppy or the lab. \n\nso my question is around my own experience, and where a drug like ketamine falls into the equation. neither a stimulant or an opiate, but a dissociative. in my late adolescence and adult life, i\u2019ve felt extreme existential confusion - not knowing which way is up, not knowing if i\u2019d prefer to exist or not to exist. and in many ways ketamine mimics this confusion (while also giving you the illusion of a very fundamental grasp on the \u2018truth\u2019 of whatever you\u2019re thinking about). but where in childhood trauma does this originate? i was born with a cleft lip. i imagine (can\u2019t remember) that this led to feeling different from other kids, to being stared at, pointed at. feeling different, feeling withdrawn. i am naturally a withdrawn person. and as i follow that logic, it makes sense that ketamine would become my drug of choice. it has a a lot of those characteristics.\n\nso, this just became a journal post. i resolved my question to the group, but will post it anyway - it may interest someone.

        "content": "need help from 15 to 16 years old (2016 - 2017) i had a codeine lean addiction which i mixed with energy drinks for the relaxation & pain relief of the lean & the caffeine from the energy drink, it made me feel invincible & i couldn\u2019t stop. til i joined the army in late 2017 which helped me gain the motivation to get clean.\n\nat 17 i broke my leg 2 months before i was supposed to start army training, i ended up getting addicted to 30mg codeine pills the doctors cut me off so i went to street dealers\u2026. big mistake i ended up taking codeine pills, cocaine & got back on the lean. \n\nby the time i was 19 i was clean from codeine lean & pills but still addicted to cocaine. i started clubbing at 19 still on the powder but i then mixed it with ecstasy too. \n\nat 20 i got clean from the cocaine & clubbing but now i\u2019m 23 & it kills me not having coke, lean & pills but i stay clean & it\u2019s hard to talk to people about it when you don\u2019t know what to say, i\u2019ve od\u2019d a few times & luckily survived but i\u2019ve seen people take coke, crack, heroin & pills, and they are sadly no longer here today some of them were people i loved & admired & i saw them fade away not realising i myself was fading away too & i didn\u2019t care. \n\nthe main reason for my post is that lately i\u2019ve been badly struggling, thinking about the pills, lean & coke but struggle with talking to those around me. drugs made me sell things i loved so i could get a fix, i robbed money just to get my shit & i just wanted to talk to people who understand what i\u2019m trying to say as i clearly have struggled here. my apologies ",

everything all the way through but honestly if felt by doing so at least right now that i would reattach and remember/re-engage with those feelings that i rather forget/move on from a little more until i\u2019m  in a stronger place.\n\ni\u2019m very thankful for this subreddit and myself for holding on to this commitment even if some days i forget here and there to post. its usually one of the first things i do when i wake up, some days after a hard morning or when waking up on the wrong side of the bed i wait so hopefully my projection of the day can be more accurate and well i forget lol.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthis mornings reflection \n\n\nthis last idk maybe 4 days have been rough to say the least. at one point i felt like i honestly was back on day 5-12. \n\nbut today i wake up feeling much lighter in many ways. i\u2019m honestly becoming a less of fan of my dreams as i used to be. maybe i\u2019m just becoming more in tune with my feelings that honestly it feels i haven\u2019t felt since a young age.\n\nlast night i had a a few dreams, but only remember my last one and i was playing basketball and even in my dream reached a point of literal fatigue. to the point i couldn\u2019t run anymore. i wanted to, it was either mine or my brothers birthday or something a we had 4 courts of people huge courts it was like 10 on 10s just having a blast. that being said waking up after this dream, im emotionally tired.\n\ni feel my dreams even though i love them for their experience i hate how they leave me so groggy in the morning. i\u2019m sure this is the years of rem sleep finally getting the chance to catch up with me.\n\ni guess that paragraph in a sense may be my issue my love for it attaches therefore possibly i must become less attached and try even to not care about them.\n\ni remember my dreams much more often then not too now a days. \n\nhonestly today i feel ok while waking up in terms of a lot less mental pressure, stress doesn\u2019t feel so so bad. i still can\u2019t stop thinking and or feeling like i\u2019m fucking my life up by simply just sitting around doing nothing but honestly i feel like at least in my own life i needed a break from everything as to part of the reason i quit weed. just total burnout.\n\nthe clock feels like it\u2019s turning so quickly nowadays. unless i\u2019m at work which is funny. cuz i feel like i\u2019m there for so long at times.\n\nbut i can\u2019t play games without 3 hours flying by in what feels like 30 minutes which leads to me feeling like \u201ci\u2019m wasting my time\u201d as the day comes to a end faster then my days of work. \n\ni only worked 3 days this week. honestly that\u2019s been my biggest obstacle and fear is that because of how much stress and anxiety i\u2019ve been dealing with that i\u2019ll eventually find myself in a finical situation that creates the same pattern. id like to become me again, even without weed i\u2019ve always been a \u201ci can handle this attitude\u201d this time around quitting has not been like my other. before i\u2019d have panic attacks i\u2019d just sit there for 30 minutes let them\npass and hop back on my horse.\nthis time around i hop on my horse and my horse falls over too.\n\ni\u2019m happy to have made it this far, a few day ago i posted the light was dimming at the end of the tunnel and that i felt like the itsy bitsy spider climbing up the spout. but it rained and wiped me out. \n\nbut i feel the rays of the sun, it\u2019s time to keep climbing and knowing the ropes will allow me to move quicker and at least reach where i was. i honestly feel i was where i was before i had my valley of despair for a few days. \n\nso in a sense i feel hope.\n\ni do look back a lot and see how much i used it to cope. honestly i think in my past i hurt a lot of people and hurt myself in the process because i loved them.\ni think i\u2019ve been running away from that. \n\nrewatching bojack horsemen has been kinda. eye opener for me at this time as his addictive behaviors become even more prevalent due  my situation. i feel like i was a hurt person hurting people not wanting to understand my own feelings and being selfish in ways.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nthe reflection of past posts.\n\nhonestly reading my posts from day 1-7 i\u2019m very happy i\u2019m not there anymore. \ni can watch tv, i enjoy playing games with my friends and just socializing. me and my gf are doing much better even though the move has been hard on us both as it\u2019s her first time\nliving on her own and both our first times dealing with compromise.\n\ni look back and am thankful in a sense that\u2019s not me anymore, but also know where i am\nand hope that in the next 3 more weeks i\u2019ll be grateful for not being where i am now. it\u2019s funny in my head this progress almost means nothing because i\u2019m not out of woods yet. \n\nmaybe it\u2019s the last 4 days being extra tough, also as i said it felt it was a valley in my recovery. so the fear that itll happen again is there.  i still know in many other ways symptoms and ect im doing much much much better. \n\ni have cried in a week at least because of weed and the overwhelming nature of quitting. i also have been sweating less continuously and getting a better sleep and even starting to\nshift my sleep patterns back naturally. not waking up at 1pm any more. now i\u2019m at 10:45 and reaching for 9am.\n\ni\u2019m very thankful to myself and this community for well giving me something to do. i rather spend my time creating these long posts for a hour of my day and reaching out to others to help then smoking my brain away all day. \n\ni always told myself i\u2019d create a life where smoking wasn\u2019t important enough to do anymore and other priorities would overtake it and i have. not realizing the flaw in my logic would be that by quitting i can\u2019t actually handle my new priorities. that being said less ones learned but i now am trying to rebuild myself to handle it all without weed. \n\ni think that was always my excuse, \u201ci\u2019ll quit when i need to\u201d which i technically did. but by doing so i put myself in my own way in many ways.\n\neither way i\u2019ve been making this post for about a hour and i gotta go eat and live my life if i wanna reflect any more upon it, good luck to everyone have a good day \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "i have an addiction with knives and its getting out of hand... hi, to start, as a child i have always loved the sound of a knife hitting a chopping board. when i got to cut veggies for the first time at 8 i was so pleased with how nicely the knife went through. as i went through school, i learned about how people used a knife to hurt people, which upset me souch, till i found out about switch blades. when i found out there are so many types of knives i was ecstatic. i don't know why though.\n\nslowly growing up as i accidentally cut my hands on the kife cutting veggies or on paper, my mind started wondering. i wondered- at the age of 10- if it would hurt way less if you knew that you were aboit to get cut. is that crazy?\n\nwhen i was 14 and in highschool, freshmen year, i stole a knife out the kitchen and sat down against my closet doors. it was an awful week, so much arguing. so i blasted music in my ears, and i did it, the first time ever, right on my thigh. i was right. it didn't hurt as bad, i was wondering if it was just my sadness, but i quickly went into just curiosity, and did it again, and again, and again... 4 cuts to make it even on both legs, i got up and it did hurt, but just barley, like someone flicked me. \n\ni felt weird as if i was faking sadness, and not like anyone else who did it. for about 2 weeks i did 2 cuts a day, one on each leg. a few days later i wore shorts, maybe i wanted attention??? i don't know why i do things anymore. but, my mom got real mad and just sternly told me \"stop that bullshit right now, that right there is not going to happen again.\" i nodded my head and went to my room, i did it again \ud83e\udd37\n\nafter stoping for two, three months or so, i started back up again in january. i got used to it. its more of a satisfaction, like, they are pretty. and i think that even with cuts, people are beautiful. but do i even have a reason? i did, i believe, but i never remember the reason to why i do things, i just keep doing them for whatever that past reason was, and make new ones along the way. \n\nanyways! people asked alright, and since we have a feisty little cat, can you guess who i blamed my scars on? well i'll tell you it was more than the cat, i blamed it on fences, dropping thing, my dog, just never said i cut myself. i have a reason too, and it makes me so mad. i get called emo as a joke by some friends who don't know that it hurts me when they say it. just the other day, a friend of mine made me swear that the cat caused my cuts, because i was wearing ripped jeans, but i wore small holed fishnets to hide em, and no one but her saw through em. i told her i don't do promises, and throughout the last 3 years, i've been telling everyone that i don't believe in promises because along with me, everyone breaks them. but ya know, like the concerned friend she is, she made me swear, or i had to tell her why. \n\ni hate that everyone always tries to force my to tell them whats wrong when they find out im upset or have scars. literally no one so far has just accepted that i don't wanna tell them, especially my mother, i can't cry at home no more because when she hears me, she gets all ipset with me not telling her whats wrong. which, you can imagine how that makes me feel.\n\ntonight my brother saw em for the 10th time and started asking stupid questions like \"does it hurt,\" \"is it easy to cut,\" after asking why a million times. i told him that i used to do it, not that i still do, and he asked \"then why are there still scars\" i just kept telling him to stop talking. infact he completely ruined the fun we were having, painting figures on eachother after he barged in my room while i didn't have pants on, just a long enough shirt. mind you, it was dark. but like the trouble maker he is, he still wanted to mess around instead of sleeping so he sat down while i was cleaning the tip for my paint dotter. and thats when everything started.\n\ni don't know how to end this off, but i just needed to tell someone. and anonymously seems great",

        "content": "i feel like this hell never ends (alcohol and meth addiction) hi guys. hope you doing well!\n\ni think i just want to share how i feel right now. any advice would be welcome, but i am starting to lose hope that anyone but myself would ever be able to help me. i am 32 and i have been dealing with this from nearly 15 years. it hasn't always been as bad as in the last 4 or 5 years. \n\ni just don't know what to do anymore... and think it is actually getting worse. i keep drinking every day, starting with a few beers around 3 hours after i get up then some vodka in the evening. after that the worse eventually comes... i decide that alcohol is not enough and i take a line or two of meth. it is not even bringing me any joy anymore, i just stay up all night staring at my phone or computer... \n\ni know it is literally poison and that i should not be taking it especially when it does not make me feel good at all anymore, it just causes me very high anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia and all kind of unpleasant physical feelings like dizinness, extreme fatique, very fast heart beat, high blood pressure and many others. on top on everything i do have panic disorder and alcohol and other stimulants like meth make it like 1000 times worse. i know all that yet i cannot stop. i also think i am aware of most of the reasons behing all this and still this is not helping me.\n\nso as i right this post i am drinking beer just to make the bad feelings after the meth i took last night be a bit more bearable. i haven't slept for a second, maybe i do skip like 3 nights of sleep every week and it is really starting to take its toll. i feel extremely weak and tired, i am really not able to do anything productive when i feel like this. i don't know what to do to regain my strenght. my energy level is close to 0. i find it hard to even get out of the house. not to mention leaving with these feelings would result in an instant panic attack. \n\nbelieve me i have tried, i have been several times in therapy, i have consulted with doctors including psychiatrists, i have tried medication (it had very bad effect). maybe i just lack the will. i got to the point where i don't feel close to normal if i don't drink a beer or two. i think all this is killing me. i am only 32 years old and at times i literally feel like my life is fading away. sometimes i wish to just smash my head with something and sometimes i got to admit that i feel like i am about to start crying (and as i said i am a grown 32 years old man). i feel so angry at myself. so helpless. i never believed it would come to this. \n\ni think i'll stop here. of course there are so many other things to share but it would be far too long to read. thanks everyone for reading this, as i said i mostly wanted to share my situation but any advice would really be helpful!",

        "content": "coping with anxiety - advice needed the hard realization that i have very bad anxiety and probably have had it all my life has hit me square in the face today.\u00a0\n\nup until this point i've looked at my cannabis addiction, my infatuation with xanax, my propensity to drink heavily, each as mutually exclusive of one another because their respective effects were so different, and i picked the habits up at different points in my life. smoking weed began in college. it was always hard for me to say that i smoked weed to cope with anxiety because i was smoking heavily before i even knew or could identify what anxiety was. plus i have read how researchers are unsure whether people consume cannabis because of anxiety, or cannabis consumption causes anxiety. drinking alcohol began in high school for fun, but basically from 18 to 28 years of age, i would drink very heavily and often to blackout. the relief that xanax brought me in my mid-30ths was my first indication of what anxiety is and that maybe i have it. when i take xanax i became incredibly productive which, through anecdotal evidence i read about on reddit, i understand to be uncommon. as xanax tamed the anxiety in my bones, something i had lived with for so long i was unaware it even existed, it also opened my eyes to the realization of what an entirely different life could be like.\u00a0\n\ni stopped consuming cannabis almost 8 weeks ago (woohoo!) and i stopped drinking around 7 weeks ago. since stopping cannabis, i have been taking xanax daily - approximately 1.5-2 mg spread throughout the day, sometimes at night to help me sleep. i am in the process of tapering off it. last night a buddy was in town and we had some drinks! it was all good, i welcomed the break. however today i recognized the exact same kind of productivity during my mild-hangover as i do when i take xanax. my brain was less busy and i was doing the mundane chores i always put off and doing them while feeling relaxed. overall it felt like i was moving through the day less frenetically. i'm aware that benzodiazepines and alcohol are in the same family but i have never experienced a similar effect between the two substances until today.\u00a0\n\nthis leads me to conclude, and maybe the few of you who are reading this are face palming yourselves because of how obvious it should have been, that yes i have bad anxiety, yes i've probably had it since childhood (i had undiagnosed ocd as a kid), and yes i likely used/use cannabis and alcohol in such extreme ways to mask this anxiety. i am by no means struggling, i am a very fortunate individual, but i haven't been able to excel in life as an adult at all. i don't consider myself successful, and because i was such an over-achiever through high school now as an adult this thought depresses me on the daily. i have addiction issues all over the place. i feel like all i do in this world is consume and provide nothing of real value or substance. i can't wrap my head around how everything in our american culture seems to revolve around making more and more money but yet people seem to readily accept this. i simply cannot figure a way to move through this world in an enjoyable and fulfilled manner.\n\nbesides obsessively working out, how do you all cope with anxiety? i know it's a simple question with complex answers. i'm just feeling shook right now because today it officially dawned on me that without a plan (or unhealthily medicating myself) there's a good chance i won't be able to pull myself out of this anxiety hole.\n\ni am currently prescribed stimulant medication for adhd, so i take 10-20 mg of vyvanse daily. admittedly i'm not even sure i have adhd. i was diagnosed in my 30s as a result of not being able to get anything done at work.",

        "content": "should i risk taking a singular benzo? bit of an odd situation. i am not actively addicted to benzos, at least not the same way i am with my other addictions. i've only taken two in my life, within probably a 3 month period for medical procedures. after the second one i noticed i started craving them, even before it had worn off i was coming up with ideas on how to get more. i haven't gotten any more since then, because they were specifically for an extremely triggering medical exam and procedure. however, i think i may need to have another exam soon, but i don't think i can do it without medication. it's not because i'm craving more, i just know i mentally can't handle the exam without help. even on the drugs i laid there just crying for hours. \n\ni guess my question is, should i see about getting another, single benzo for this exam? it's just one, and the prescription is obviously highly strict so i wouldn't be able to get more. but i'm worried if i take one again the urges are gonna come back stronger. \n\nif you think i shouldn't take one, which is valid and i'm contemplating it myself, is there something else i could take or get prescribed? i have access to oxy, which somehow i haven't gotten addicted to despite taking it a few times and having constant access to it. but i'm worried taking it during such a high stress situation could also cause the urges for it.\n\nsorry if this makes no sense, it's 4am and my mind is racing. i've never talked with anyone about this fear before.",

        "content": "okay, i\u2019m about to snap so here\u2019s a quick run down of my drug history and my issue:\n\ni started using pain pills at the age of 13.  started with lortabs & vicodin then around 14 went to percocet and started smoking weed. 15 i was hooked on opanas, roxicets (roxicodone), and heroin. i quit the pills and stuck with heroin for another 5-6 years while adding in cocaine & crack, meth, fentanyl, and pretty much anything i could get. \n\nnow i\u2019m almost 26, and have been sober from anything hard for quite some time now. i got on suboxone and was prescribed klonopin, then xanax because i have severe anxiety, panic disorder, and social phobia. \n\nwell my doctor wanted to put me back on klonopin near the end of last year, and i was totally against it as the xanax worked faster and more efficiently for the last 3-4 years. she said i was being argumentative and threw me out of the program. so now i\u2019ve been looking for a doctor or psychiatrist to continue me on my much needed nerve medication but they all see my past as a fucking addict, and totally shut me down before i can even say anything. like today for example; a nurse practitioner had my list of medications from the online computer system doctors use, and when she asked why i was seeking treatment with them, i replied \u201ci was hoping for your guys help with my anxiety and -\u201c she cut me off saying \u201cwell im just going to tell you now, you won\u2019t be getting anything from before like any benzodiazepines or anything else\u201d \n\ni said that was the only thing that worked for me, and has for years but she said it wasn\u2019t happening. this isn\u2019t the first, second, or third time since october 2024 that this kind of conversation has been had between myself and doctors/psychiatrist offices either. \n\ni just don\u2019t get it.. i can\u2019t leave the fucking house without feeling like i\u2019m going to die of a heart attack from being so stressed out from the sheer fact of not being in my house. \n\nthey\u2019re literally pushing me to do what i\u2019m doing now; buying them off the streets! not to get high, i don\u2019t get a buzz off benzos anymore & haven\u2019t for years. it\u2019s just so i can feel \u201cnormal\u201d. (and yes, i take precautions. it\u2019s a family member who gets them prescribed & sells some to me) \n\ni\u2019m sorry for this long rant, im just beyond upset that they only look at my past, and don\u2019t take into consideration how people change. the suboxone alone should be a clear indication of that!

        "content": "i think addiction to either food or sex are probably the hardest to get control of i say this because both food are sex are biologically needed. with drunk and drugs you don't actually need them. fair enough with drink and some other drugs withdrawal can be dangerous and you need medical intervention, but once you get past that, you can stay off them indefinitely (not saying it's easy because i know from 1st hand experience due to previous addiction to ghb a few times and diazepam) \n\nsex is different because you won't get withdrawal symptoms nor will you die, but for a lot of people it a biological need that if not met will lead to depression, apathy, and other things. but also because it's not recognized as an addiction even though it can be addictive. some people can cut out sex if it's problematic for them, but some won't be able to as the biological drive will eventually take over essentially. so instead of just cutting it out they have to learn how to have a healthy relationship with it and to not binge on it which usually needs therapy to overcome, but therapy isn't for everyone nor is a good therapist easy to find. \n\nfood is different as well as it's not really an addiction, it's a necessity, but the relationship that people can have with it can become problematic. like an alcoholic won't drink because some will say if they have one it will lead to 15 as they struggle to stop once they do start, but you can't do the same with food. instead the only option is to learn how to moderate, eat healthily and learn how to eat without binging as it can't just be cut out. \n\n(p.s. i know it depends on the individual, and i'm not saying sex or food addiction are the same or are worse than drug or alcohol addiction, just was thinking about this though. if you get where i'm coming from then cool)",

        "content": "my diary: day 1 - how porn and sex destroyed my marriage warning: my posts will contain mentions of an extramarital affair, pornography addiction, and an attempted suicide attempt. please do not read any further if that may be too much for you.\n\nhey everyone. this is the beginning of my journey from a crazed porn addict and sex fiend who single handedly destroyed his marriage and had an affair to now working on recovering mentally as a divorced man. this will be a long series, and i plan on making as many updates to this as i can so that hopefully i can continue along a better path and work on bettering myself. ideally i\u2019ll make a new post every day, but that may not be possible with my work schedule. we will see.\n\nbefore we get into this, i know many people are going to think i am a terrible human being and that i deserve everything that has happened to me. and the sad reality is, you're 100% correct. i am a piece of shit. the most i can do though is move on and learn from the horrible mistakes i've made, because i can't erase it as much as i would love to.\n\ni will be reading comments and looking at and answering questions but will not be accepting dms or messages.\n\ncharacters:\n\nme - 28m, autistic and quite dependent.\n\nmy wife - 26f, very independent minded, very supportive. she is my girlfriend for the first 8 years of this story but i will refer to her as my wife throughout to make things a bit easier.\n\n\"k\" - f, age unknown, friend that i met through gaming.\n\n\u201cb\u201d - f, age unknown, likely early to mid 20s. the person i had the affair with.\n\nethan - 27m, an alter ago of me. made up character that does not actually exist.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\ni would be lying to you if i said that i had a perfect marriage. the truth is, i didn\u2019t. that doesn\u2019t excuse my actions. but everything began happening around the time i got married in fall of 2024. prior and post to getting married, me and my wife struggled with intimacy. we very rarely had sex. i can count on one hand how many times we had done it in the past two years. it wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t enjoying it either. every time we did end up having sex i could tell she was being pleasured quite a bit. and even if i finished before she did, i would always help her off. but moments like that between us were always few and far in between. i didn\u2019t know what the issue was. when we first started dating well over 8 years ago, we had sex all the time. she went to a military college for a while which made it hard to see her at first but even then we would be sexting whenever she had free time. and we had a good healthy, sexual relationship for the first two or three years of our relationship.\n\nso what happened that changed things for us that reduced the sex? well, it wasn\u2019t too long around this time (early to mid 2018) that we began to live together. it should be important to note that my wife comes from a very chaotic family and had a difficult upbringing. her parents are separated and she just lived with her mom and little sister for a while. either way, when we finally began living in an apartment together, it was for the first time ever that she didn\u2019t have any chaos or uncertainty or instability in her life. she could just live in the apartment with me while we both go to school and work. in hindsight, this may have not been the best idea. my wife has become so used to chaos in her life that she would later admit to me that she almost broke up with me because things were almost going too well. i didn\u2019t understand it at the time, but honestly it makes sense when i think about it. it was from that point onward that the sex became less and less. she also began using birth control around the time we moved in together, which she told me at one point may have messed up her hormones, but i have no idea if it plays any role in our relationship.\n\nit should be important to note that communication has always been an issue for me throughout my life. my autism plays a big part into it, but i also tend to be a compulsive liar. i lie about things i don\u2019t even need to lie about. i told my mom once that i went to get a haircut, she was curious if i got my haircut at location a, but i would tell her i actually got it at location b, even though i actually got it at location a. it\u2019s just small things like that. i will say in my defense, it got better as i got older since i recognized it as a problem. it still persisted, but it was nowhere near as bad, but it does come into play later. anyway, i\u2019m a poor communicator. i knew that something had changed but i didn\u2019t know how to talk to her about it. in my head, how was i supposed to say \u201chey babe, i\u2019ve been noticing i haven\u2019t been getting laid any time recently. what\u2019s up with that?\u201d. if i had, then maybe i wouldn\u2019t be sitting here typing all of this out today. so that\u2019s when i turned to it. that\u2019s when i began seeking out other external means of getting satisfaction that would later lead me down to a rabbit hole that i would never come out of. i\u2019m talking of course about pornography.\n\nfor a while, i watched porn and nothing would happen. it was just normal, vanilla porn and i would be satisfied just from watching it and masturbating. it was almost a daily occurrence for me, but i didn't see anything wrong with it. in my head, everyone does it. and to an extent, i suppose it is true. but i began to get a little desperate. i would become a bit of a sex fiend. i would try to grab my wife's breasts while we were in bed when she clearly wasn't in the mood, or i would try to talk her into it of course to no avail. that's when \"k\" comes into the picture.\n\nsomething important to note about k is that she's a lesbian and i met her through video gaming. in fact, she was such a good friend of mine that even my wife knew who she was since we would have gaming sessions together sometimes. and k was lesbian clear as day; not bisexual or anything. my wife trusted us despite the fact that k was fairly attractive. and for a while, she had no reason not to trust us. that did end up changing though. at the time, k had a girlfriend. her girlfriend was apparently bisexual. her girlfriend had suggested to her that she and k should have a threesome with another guy. when k told me that, i didn't really care because that's their personal life. fast forward a few days and they end up meeting up with some guy for a potential threesome but didn't end up doing anything; they just chatted and potentially planned it for a later date. i don't know what happened, but something in k made her uncomfortable with that whole ordeal and she came to me upset. i'm not sure if it was because having a threesome with another guy terrified her as a lesbian, or if there was some other reason, but she later told me while she was crying that if she were to ever have a threesome, she wouldn't want it to be with anyone she doesn't know, and said that the only way she would do it is if it was with me.\n\ni was pretty shocked at first. i didn't know what to say. up until this point (mid to late 2018) i hadn't even thought of k in a sexual way. how could i? she was a lesbian, she was one of my best friends, i had a girlfriend, and so did she. but that night, everything changed. i saw her as a potential sexual partner even though we lived in completely different states. she asked me to show my dick to her, which i did, and then she began showing me her breasts and other areas. i didn't know what to think, but i didn't need to think anything. my best friend was literally sexting with me and that's all i cared about. but it didn't end there.\n\nk and i sexted for a while. for months. she actually became more obsessed over it than me, partly because her and her girlfriend were having major issues of their own. i don't know if her girlfriend ever found out, but that's neither here nor there. i had a sexting partner and i was extremely satisfied. i eventually would get caught though. my girlfriend asked to see my phone once while i was flirting with k and she read through everything. she was devastated, upset, unsure if she wanted to continue in the relationship. i was groveling. i didn't want to lose someone who i saw as my future wife. fast forward a few days and she agreed to give me another chance on the condition that i block k completely, never contact her again, and surrender my phone whenever i am asked to do so. i complied. i had to in order to save my relationship. and i genuinely wanted to turn things around. and up until about 6 months ago (mid to late 2024), i did. things were okay between me and my girlfriend. i wasn't talking to anyone else in a sexual way. i moved on. i was still addicted to porn though, which at this point became an unfixable issue for me.\n\ni was still watching porn like crazy for the four years after i cheated on my girlfriend. at this point, it's the middle of 2024 and me and my girlfriend are finally engaged. even though i have this addiction, life is mostly good. but we still aren't having sex, hardly ever at all. keep in mind that communication for me is still something that is nearly impossible for me. i didn't know how to tell her my problems. i knew pornography helped me at least forget my problems though. i can't tell you how or when this exactly happened, but regular porn was no longer enough. i began watching fetish stuff. and not just common fetishes. i mean some super weird, dark, insane, god awful things that would make most people squeamish at just the mention of. i relied on fetish porn. i had so many fetishes that honestly even i began to get worried. but as usual, i ignored my problems. i wasn't having sex and my urge was becoming worse. i needed to have sex. if i wasn't going to get it from my wife, i was going to get it somehow. so what did i do? i decided to make an alter ego. someone completely separate from me, even though it was still me. i made a fake snapchat account and a fake name, calling myself ethan and coming up with a fake persona, job, and everything else you could fake about a person. i was able to add a few people locally thanks to how easy it is to add people with snapchat, but nobody i talked to i really things off with. i eventually thought looking for sex was just a waste of time, but then one day, i began talking to \"b\". b would forever change my life for the worse.\n\npart 2 in the coming days. i know i was kind of all over the place in terms of how i present my story so i'll try to work on that in the future.",

        "content": "all i think about is how much i want xanax all my life i have battled with drugs off all kinds. but xanax was the one that always had my heart. \n\ni\u2019ve been off xanax for 4 months now. last year, i was using xanax for most of the year. i had relapsed again and it was bad. i was taking so many bars a day, i couldn\u2019t even put a number on it. \n\nin october, i was driving home from work and kept nodding off. i would wake up on the highway, going 70mph, swerving in between lanes. i didn\u2019t pull over, i just kept waking up, slapping myself thinking i would keep my eyes open this time. well, the last time i nodded off, i didn\u2019t wake up until i had flipped my car four times. i gained consciousness during the last 2 flips of the car. i was upside down but managed to unbuckle my seatbelt. luckily, the windshield was smashed, so i crawled through there while the car caught on fire. \n\ni couldn\u2019t walk. i could barely move. when i got to the hospital, they told me i fractured my spine, ribs, sternum, and hips. i shattered the heel in my right foot and broke my ankle. i totaled my car, no insurance (i let my insurance lapse because i was dumb as fuck and barely conscious most of the time), i lost my job, i lost my apartment, i lost everything. \n\nso four months go by, im still not walking due to a complication with my foot surgery. i\u2019m not really doing anything at all, besides sitting at home thinking about all that i could\u2019ve done differently. but my frustration lies with my addiction, because despite all that xanax has brought upon my life, i want it back. \n\ni want it back more than anything. i would trade all the help i am receiving from my friends and family, the help that\u2019s kept a new roof over my head and my belly full, the help that keeps my insurance paid so i can see doctors, the help that gives me support in life, i would trade it all if i could have xanax back in my life. \n\ndo you hear how selfish that sounds? it\u2019s disgusting, i know. i hate it. i hate that im like this. but on the same note, i also do not care. every day, i think about xanax. how good it made me feel. how it changed how i viewed myself and the confidence it gave me. how complete i was when i had it. i didn\u2019t need a boyfriend, or friends, or support, or food in my stomach, or a job that kept me distracted. i felt like i had everything in the world when i had xanax. \n\nwhy, after all of this, all of the years of relapse, almost fucking dying in a car fire, losing my job, finding myself in debt $30,000 because i can\u2019t pay any of my bills anymore and still owe on the car, no longer able to walk normally, everything that offered some sense of security in my life just ripped from my hands, why would i want the thing that irreversibly ruined my life? why can\u2019t i let it go? why do i feel like i absolutely need it to survive? \n\ni thought that the universe was offering a second chance when i woke up from that car accident. the fact that i woke up at all in time to escape the car is a miracle. i\u2019ve thought about all the reasons why what has happened to me, happened. and it\u2019s all because i let my addiction spiral again. it\u2019s all my fault, i know. but it\u2019s all because i was on xanax. so shouldn\u2019t i hate the drug that caused me so much suffering? \n\ni\u2019ve been racking my brain trying to think of someone i can hit up who might sell it. i\u2019m worried i\u2019ll buy something pressed with fent. but im willing to take that chance, just to feel it again. the little money i have saved, i\u2019ll spend it on xanax. but before i go too far, i just want to hear what you guys have to say. something to talk me off the ledge, because i know what i want to do is wrong. i know there\u2019s a chance of me relapsing again and possibly dying. \n\ni know there\u2019s a part of me that wants to beat this. but right now, that\u2019s not the part of me i\u2019m in touch with. please help me. \n\ntldr; i\u2019ve been off xanax for 4 months. it irreversibly ruined my life and almost killed me. but right now i don\u2019t care. i want it back. there\u2019s a part of me that wants to beat my addiction, but that\u2019s not the part im feeling right now. before i hit up the plug, i want to hear if there\u2019s anything anyone can say that can help me.

(he now realizes it was his porn addled brain seeing things that weren't there.) the thought of her being into him excited him so much that he premeditated a plan to find out if she really was and still have deniability if she wasn't. about a week later he was in the house with her while our toddler son napped and i was at the store. he confronted her and asked in an accusatory tone if she \"was showing off for him\". she of coarse was horrified and said no! she told me about it and i thought it was so odd that he wouldn't mention it to me and that he would say anything too her at all but he said he thought it was so wrong, he had to confront her. so he was really testing the waters and picked the perfect time, with our child sleeping and me at the store, in case he could act on his fantasy. now, he is so ashamed and disgusted by his behavior. he says he was immediately after and has been struggling with the shame of it over the years. \n\ni am greatful that our communication has gotten so good that he was finally honest when i asked him a few nights ago. it's something that i don't think would have ever gone away because it never felt right. \n\nso like i said, i understand the addiction, the escalation and how an addict can rationalize any behavior but to cross the line into physically acting out, and with my mother. i am having such a a hard time. i'm in betrayal trauma mode all over again. \n\ni know no one can tell me to stay or leave. i guess i'm hoping some of you will validate what he's saying about the thinking and actions this particular drug can lead you too. the duality of who he is with and without porn is so mind boggling. the cognitive disconance actually hurts. is blaming the addiction valid? we've been together 26 years. he's my best friend. i want to help him. i want our family to stay whole. i know he loves me and i believe he's never had a physical affair but knowing he tried to, and with my mother....\n\n",

        "content": "a sappy thank you to the man who altered his life to save mine as the title suggests, i'm feeling all emotional as i approach my two year's clean mark, and i just wanted to put this out into the world. its nothing special, just putting my feelings out there. \n\ni had a lot going on when i was young - i was being sexually abused, gay in a very hick town, and my best friend (and secret boyfriend) ended his own life when we were seventeen. \n\non top of all this - i'm a cowboy. i grew up being told men don't have emotions, men don't cry, men need to be tough as nails and theres absolutely no time to talk about your feelings. i followed those arbitrary rules so hard because i was so deeply in the closet. where else does all this trauma and grief go if it can't be processed? it goes into cocaine. \n\nwhen i was eighteen i started partying late after rodeos, and started doing lines to keep the adrenaline going so i didn't have to feel the dissociative crash. it started getting more and more frequent, and it became my go to whenever i started to have a flashback (was later diagnosed with cptsd.) can't panic when you're getting high. this went on for two years.  \n\neveryone knew i was doing coke on the weekends, what young cowboy wasn't? but an older bronc rider pulled me aside to ask about it. he could tell i was knee deep in a real problem, which i'm sure i wasn't hiding as well as i thought. \n\nthe thing that made him stick out to me was he was patient. he was gentle and kind, didn't try to \"scare me straight\" or \"knock some sense into me\" like some others did. he was gentle. thats a word that sticks out lots to me. \n\ni ended up on his couch for ten months, a lot of it a blur as i fell between active addiction to recovery to relapse and back. he was steady and kind through all of it. never forced anything on me, never reprimanded me for a relapse, was nothing but supportive. it was groundbreaking. there was this pinnacle of a manly man - a beloved and talented bronc rider, cowboy down to his bones... showing emotion and letting me.. cry? \n\nhe sat with me for three and a half hours on the bathroom floor when i had my first sober flashback. he stayed awake until the sun rose to make sure i was safe after i tried to od. he comforted me morning to night when i finally let go enough to tell him everything that happened to me. he took care of me like this for ten months. \n\nwhen i rallied myself enough to move into my own place - he told me that he had lost his own son to addiction, and that i made him so so proud. it was crazy, this guy i'd known for just over a year loved me like that. but it was his love that got me sober, that got me into therapy, got me comfortable with my sexuality and allowed me to continue to do the sport i love. \n\nthis is just me being eternally grateful for him and saying that things can get better even if its gritty and dirty work. i might not be entirely okay yet, i still spend more days grieving than not, but i can actually do something about it now. he gave me agency, more than anything, and that's such a groundbreaking gift.

        "content": "recently sober i'm recently fully, 100% sober from drugs and alcohol for the first time in over 30 years. this is my story....(warning...long post with many references of drugs and alcohol, if this violates community standards, i'm sorry)\n\ni consciously started drinking when i was 12 years old. it was always innocent at first. we'd sneak a beer or cooler out of gramma's fridge and share it with friends at the playground, or our friends older siblings would give us a half shot of whatever they were drinking. it was fun. we felt a bit rebelious at that young age. by 15, i was mixing vodka in my slurpee cup at school every day, and always finding the party on weekends. we all had fake id's and our one friend's uncle owned a bar. never thought much of it, just stupid normal teenage antics. it was never a problem. \n\ni was introduced to cocaine at 16 years old. no one pressured me in to it, i did it of my own volition. it was awesome that first time. i remember that first high. it was the friday, and my 16th birthday party that night. i bumped a couple rails in the bathroom with one of my friends brothers, and just felt like i was flying. he let me keep the rest as a birthday present. i did a few more rails that night with another friend. we were on top of the world. and from then i was hooked. though, like booze, it was never a big thing. if it was there, i'd do it. i never sought it out for the first while. then at 18, it changed. i was doing it every weekend. \n\nfrom 18 - 23 i was full out fucked up. a bottle of jack, absolut, and cuervo plus an 8 ball? that was friday. saturday was mdma, jack, and more coke. the people i did it with were the best friends i ever had. we all worked in similar jobs with similar schedules so it was easy to keep it going. \n\nat 23, i went to the first funeral of a friend who passed from an od. i'm not proud of this moment in my life. his girlfriend and i came together - we were both high on coke. we justified it in our heads saying he would've wanted it that way. as the celebration party went on, his dad joined us in doing coke and drinking. his girlfriend dropped some mdma and started making out with me, and then his dad. i had to take her out of there before his mom unalived her. she crashed at my place, but not before we finished 2 bottles of jack. (before anyone asks, nothing happened that night...i told her she wasn't in the right frame of mind to consider doing things with). \n\nafter that, there was more funerals. 2 or 3 a year for a few years. it was always the person that would sober up for a long time who went hard one night thinking they were okay. i od'd twice, and almost died once. was in hospital for 3 days the first time. i lied and told my mom it was a heart condition. was too embarrassed to have her think i was a drug addict. i started to taper down the cocaine to once or twice a month after that. \n\nin 2008, i was 26. i went to 11 funerals and 5 birthday parties that year. the friends that died tried harder drugs then coke. usually heroin or oxycontin. they'd get a bad batch or take a lethal dose, and then it was lights out. i never touched that shit, so i was okay. well, that was my rationale. i moved in with my girlfriend around that time, and she didn't know i was doing cocaine. it was infrequent enough around then that i could easily conceal it. we both drank. i'd traded drinking a bottle of jack and a bottle of absolut every night then to a bottle of red wine with dinner and more on weekends. it was social and fun. we felt like we could conquer the world then. i overhaulled the friend group then too, tried to stay away from the friends choosing drugs over moving ahead in life. \n\nmay long weekend 2009. i went to chilliwack to help and old friend move. we were having an amazing weekend. writing songs with him playing guitar. partying. snorting coke. drinking jack. full out rockstar mode. at 930pm in the saturday, i went to go get more booze. i should've taken the keys with me. i was walking and it wasn't a long walk to the liquor store. i grabbed what i thought would get us through the night (a 40 of jim beam), and made my way back. he'd passed out. his girlfriend didn't get off work until 1am. so, i went and sat on a bench in a park drinking my bourbon. i was approached by a woman asking if i was on my way to a party. i said i got locked out of my buddies. she told me to come with her. we drank my bourbon as we walked to her run down motel room. she then broke out some coke, and we drank and got high. she told me she wouldn't charge me if i wanted to have sex because she drank most of the bourbon. i noped out of there in a hurry. \n\ni quit doing cocaine in that moment. i figured if my actions were leading me to do blow in a seedy motel with a hooker, i should re-evaluate my life choices. and i did. it has been almost 16 years since then, and save for a couple pot brownies and a couple hits from a weed pipe, i've not touched a drug since. people around me state this is the thing they are most amazed by. \n\ni quit drinking for a time then too. that lasted until shortly before my 28th birthday. roughly 5 months fully sober. i was okay to have a few drinks to celebrate my annual spin around the sun. i mean, why not. i didn't go hard, but i for sure did over do it. and from that point i was back on the sauce. \n\nin late 2012, i moved from vancouver to northern manitoba for work. i looked at it as an opportunity to re-imagine myself. i tried to sober up. that didn't work so well. at one bar, heineken was $4/bottle. halloween night, i went hard. my hands nor bottle were never empty until they ran out of heineken. that was it for me. i drank almost every day for 6 months. it was the only real friend i had there. my next closest friend was 8 hours east. the closest city was 13 hours south. it was me and jim beam. that's it. i went for a walk one night. it was -45\u00b0c out. i walked the train tracks, depressed and alone, drinking from the bottle. i sat down on the train bridge over the frozen solid north saskatchewan river. i dropped the empty bottle and watched it smash on the ice below. that was it, i was going to jump. i was a drunk, and being there couldn't help me. luckily, someone i met saw me and stopped me. they drove me home and made sure i was warm. i moved back to vancouver shortly after that happened. \n\ni cut back on the drinking from that moment until i turned 35. i had a kid. i had a good job. life was great. but my 35th birthday was a drunken festival of me. and from then until this past weekend, i've not been okay when drinking. i wasn't a daily or even weekly drinker, but i'd go hard when i did. during covid, my father passed. he said to me on his last day alive was that i have a kid now and i should give up whatever vices i had to focus on being a dad. rich advice from the man that never did the same until it was too late for him. \n\nthis past weekend, my girlfriend of 7.5 years and i went to spend time at a cabin with some friends. from the moment we arrived, there was never not a drink in my hand. whiteclaw mostly. first night was chill. we got in late, and didn't go to hard. 2nd night? oh boy. i. went. hard. i remember parts of the night, certain conversations, certain activities, etc. but i don't recall everything. i'm told i was belligerent, that i came down on friends for past things, and that i refused to go upstairs to check on my girlfriend. the problem is, i don't not believe it. you know that scene in the simpsons were homer imagines he was talking to the president at an old time cocktail party? yeah, in my mind that was how i thought i was when drinking. it was a long car ride home. my girlfriend gave me the riot act. and this week i've been in my own head. \n\ni need to get better and be a better version of me. and as long as i have alcohol, that isn't going to happen. i've talked to my doctor about finding counselling and supports, but the wait time is extensive. this is going to be a difficult journey. and i hope i can get through it.

        "content": "long term ketamine abuse for starters, i\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s currently. over the past two years i have struggled with severe ketamine abuse, on multiple occasions to the point of unbearable physical pain (stomach cramping and bladder) which has put me in urgent cares and the er on multiple occasions. it started while i was recovering from cocaine addiction, it had the opposite effect on me which i enjoyed and i was still able to fill my nasal fixation. i had been kicked out of my home and while having significant savings, was unable to find housing for a long while. during that period alone i spent over half of my remaining savings on ket, days blurring together and my bank account going unchecked as i continued to pick up more and more, even staying at my at the time plugs house overnight on occasion high off my ass. i ended up finding a place to stay, but being away from my family only made it easier to keep consuming more. i progressed into bulk buying after retaining a job for a while, which is when i started doing it to a completely vile extent (this is well over a year ago) and ended up with severe cramping and bladder issues. i continued using it throughout due to thinking the ket subdued the pain and it was from something else (it obviously wasn\u2019t). after realizing where the issues stemmed from i significantly lowered my usage for a moth or two, still using around a gram a day which shockingly was minimal for me. a few months ago i managed to go two weeks sober, which i did solely to pass a drug test for a new job. after getting the job i relapsed, spending more and more again and getting to the point where i\u2019d leave work to go pick up and get high. i ended up losing that job likely due the absences and have been without stable work ever since, still managing to get high almost every day down to my last penny. nearing the end of this month i have $1 to my name, my monthly spend for ketamine being nearly double what i pay for rent. as much as i can bear to go without it, i am in such close quarters with the ability to keep abusing it. 4+ plugs within a 15 min radius, one of which living walking distance. no matter what time of day or night, i know i can get it from one of them. this cycle has ruined a lot of things in my life, and in that regard only i am to blame. dishonesty, hiding away in my room and away from these issues, and never going to the meetings people forward to me. i am coming to the full realization that i am giving up everything for one thing, and that i have prioritized this one thing over everything else for so god damn long. if there\u2019s anyone on this sub who has dealt with this extreme abuse in regards to ketamine specifically i\u2019d like to hear your experience or advice, whether you\u2019re in active addiction or recovery. i\u2019m experiencing my own wake up call individually but need some serious advice on how to rid myself of this. it\u2019s truly gone too far.",

        "content": "my best friend does 6 grams of ketamine a day, how do i support them with this. context: we live in the uk, healthcare services are free however have exceptionally long wait times and often reject patients. they are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, ptsd, clinical depression, anxiety, adhd and autism and use ketamine to cope with all the emotional instability that comes with it all along with traumatic events that have made it worse, all along the lines of rape, sexual exploitation and grooming - however the abuse has now become a habit.  their drug support services have abandoned them and refuse to take them back. their room is really not in a good state to live in and they constantly go out with friends who sell them k. they are starting university in september and will be moving into university accomodation away from family in a major city that is quite known for ketamine abuse. they feel a lot of shame because of the idea of what their parents will think of them having put a lot of pressure on them as a child to succeed in life.\n\ni am not an addict, nor do i ever do k, but i occasionally do other drugs. i live quite far from them and it takes me about a 30 minute train and a 15 minute bus to get to their house, but i can't go unless their parents are out and they can't ever come to mine, however i'm moving out independently in april so will try housing them to get away from home. i would really appreciate some advice on how i can support my friend and help them get professional help. i've told them that i will never judge or shame them for their problem and have given them some encouraging words that they should be proud of how far they've come and offered to clean their room. what else can i do? i really feel bad for my best friend and want what's best for them.",

        "content": "talking about my experience with addiction to weed and nicotine hey everyone, just felt like writing my experience down and sharing it.\n\ni first tried vaping in march of 2023, but it hurt my throat when i inhaled it, so i was like \"wow, that hurt, i'm never vaping again. thank god.\" beginning in may of 2023, i began to start using weed, and by september, i began using it a lot more often. it wasn't until november of 2023 when i got my first vape buzz, and my throat was alright because i had smoked a cigarette just a minute prior. it hit so hard and i felt so relaxed and \"high\" and felt like i was \"tripping\". i closed my eyes and let it ride out for like a minute. after that, i was hooked. i got my first vape a week or two later. i would hit it instead of getting high on weed, as kind of a balance, and it was alright. then, i quit for probably a few months with ease.\n\ni got back into vaping probably around april after i became depressed. i would wake up, go to school, then go to work until 8, 9, or 10 pm, go home, immediately go into my room, pop 40 mg of weed, and then sit and listen to my records. then, when my high was peaking, and i had the right song on, i would hit my vape for 4 seconds, exhale, wait like 5 - 20 seconds, and then repeat about 5 - 6 times to get a huge head rush. i would feel like i was tripping, just like people did in the 60s with acid and music. it felt really good and i looked forward to doing that every single night from probably april - late august. i tried quitting a few times but couldn't bring myself to it.\n\nin early september, i decided i wanted to quit vaping because my lungs were kind of hurting and so was my chest and my head (i had migraines like 2-5 times a week beginning in march so vaping didn't help it). i finally had 2 or 3 days where i didn't get high or vape, but then i had a sudden panic attack while being high. i hit my vape like 6 times per usual and then noticed my heart rate wasn't going down and was speeding up, which gave me my scariest moment in my life. i thought i was dying and my heart rate was probably at 120-150 bpm for two hours. since then, i have not felt the same and am always anxious and tense, and i haven't felt relaxed since before the attack. my mind is also constantly foggy and spacey all the time thanks to the weed and vaping.\n\nhowever, i have not hit a vape since then, nor done any nicotine, and i stopped using caffeine as it increases my heart rate. i quit doing weed as much (currently a month and a half clean) but i'm still depressed and anxious and eat a shit ton. i do wish that i could go back in time and not vape but i wish that i could still get high, as it truly relaxed me.\n\nanyway, that's it. sorry if some parts are written horribly, it's hard for me to concentrate and write and think. post your thoughts if you got any! i like talking about it to people.\n\n",

        "content": "i lost my best friend after years of drug abuse and i can\u2019t find peace \n\n\nmy friend was the funniest dude ever, he could make your head explode in 5 seconds he was charismatic and fun loving. i want to remember him for the good times. but everything has been clouded in negativity after he passed and i don\u2019t know how to feel. he loved to party, his family knew that, he was in and out of rehab, his parents spent thousands, exhausted everything, tried to shut him out, tried to beg him to stay, he got his hands on a lot of hard drugs and i was there when he was actively using. i never partook when he was doing opiates. but i wanted to be there for my friend, when it was clear he was in need of help, i actually sat with him in his hotel room, completely sober with narcan in my hand, cpr mask in my bag, and 911 ready to go. i sat and watched him and talked to him. because, i\u2019m not sure, it\u2019s all i could think to do. because i couldn\u2019t stop him, literally fought him over it and he ran off, one time he stayed at my place and a creepy drug dealer was invited into my home, and i was gonna beat the crap out of the dealer but he ran off, i chased him down the block in broad daylight, and i had to later kick my friend out of my apartment for it, he had nobody at that time. i broke down in tears a few times ngl, i begged him to go to his family, and he said if i told his parents they would disown him. eventually his grandpa was going to pass away soon, so i drove him 6 hours out to his family home, he didn\u2019t have a car, i thought maybe this was my chance to find a safe person within the family to inform. and i decided to tell his brother\u2019s gf. she lived with the family and was close to his mom, knew his mom well and seemed caring and yet would be able to process the news a little easier and decide the best course of action, she basically told me what i stated earlier. that he\u2019s been like this since she first met him years ago and the family exhausted everything. i told her basically \u201c keep a close eye on him if it gets any worse while he\u2019s around y\u2019all, you have the choice to tell his mother.\u201d now that he\u2019s dead though, i feel like i should of told his mom outright and took those chances and asked her not to disown him or punish him or stop giving him money as it was his only way of surviving. but i didn\u2019t. and i don\u2019t know if the gf ever warned anyone or did anything. shortly after i took him to his parents and told the brothers gf, i realized she was also abusing stimulants molly coke and acid regularly and he got a lot of access to it through her, then i thought \u201coh damn maybe i told the wrong person.\u201d but his family kind of knew that and normalized that about her and his brother, so i actually did do acid that we got from his brothers gf with him thinking it would \u201cheal\u201d him, i felt in my head that it was a better alternative. because everyone was mourning the death of his grandfather and so was he. fast forward months after him and i got into a big argument, the worst one ever and it got really dangerous and i feared for my safety. i felt like i didn\u2019t know what else to do for him and i stopped talking to him for a year. that was the end of our friendship. i left him at his parents house where he stayed for a year. i saw him lurking around on my instagram stories 2 days before he passed and liking my posts, then he later died. \n\n\n\nnow after his death people are asking questions. and people who knew him started to gossip. he was a super popular guy and hid his addiction very well he also had quite a few haters. it\u2019s gotten so bad his family will be making the funeral private. i respect their decision but it makes me a little sad i won\u2019t get to say goodbye. he knew a lot of shady or vapid people that i didn\u2019t like. he had sooo many girlfriends, all at once sometimes. and it caused a lot of trouble for him, even after death, i had random girls calling up, i had someone accuse me of doing opiates with him because they knew i sat with him and watched him while he got high. another person was suspecting foul play and asked me if i thought \u201cso and so\u201d would drug my friend or if i was hiding something or if i knew any dealers. the cause of death or toxicology report has not been released, and yet everyone is saying it\u2019s this drug or that drug, which is also bizarre because maybe he wasn\u2019t even doing drugs, i don\u2019t want his legacy to just be a drug addict, he was still more than that. for the friends who didn\u2019t know us that well, i am angry that i can\u2019t just mourn my friend. i did everything under the sun to find him help. and when i thought of the last place to find it, it was unclear that it was the right situation for him. maybe i should have done more, but i literally put my own safety on the line for him. i don\u2019t know if telling his mom would have done anything, or if opiates were even the drug that killed him, since he had access to coke and molly at his parents place. all i want is to find peace, know in my heart that i had his best interest in my mind, and say goodbye to my best friend. \n\ntldr: my friend was abusing opiates i did everything to help him, he had a bad relationship with his family at the time, so i was careful about telling them. i told someone in the family but i don\u2019t know if it was the right person bc that person later did coke and molly. later i fought with him and we stopped talking. he later died and now everyone is pointing fingers at eachother when all i want to do is cry.\n",

(i have some family members who are addicts as well) \n\nhe has been sober from fent since march 24th and i really am proud of him. i try to remind him of this constantly. for a few months after getting off fent he turned to coke. i knew this bc i caught him again 4 separate times. he claims that is over with and he is fully committed to getting better and moving on with life. my issue is these old \u201ctendencies\u201d don\u2019t seem to go away. by this i mean he will have these unexplainable \u201cerrands\u201d he\u2019s needing to run (after it takes 2 hours to go to the grocery store he blames it on adhd), somedays he will be up super late and blame it on stress, he never seems to have money and by this i mean he will have just enough to get by even though i know he\u2019s making more and should have more, the way he treats his belongings he breaks everything (phones / technology) and loses everything and makes a mess looking for things. he will have some anxiety attacks that to me seem like paranoia. \n\nin my mind this is signs someone is on drugs or hiding it. but on the other hand he tells me how he needs to \u201cunlearn\u201d these habits and change his lifestyle. i guess i just don\u2019t want to look stupid once again by missing anything. i have ptsd for sure with the situation because of how i found out about his addiction. i guess i\u2019m just curious with other addicts if this is normal. did you find it hard to undo these habits? am i stupid? \n\n i try my best to be sensitive about it because i don\u2019t want to discredit anything he has done but it comes to a point where i can\u2019t justify and continue to question this behavior but i also don\u2019t want to trigger anything. i\u2019m at a loss.

        "content": "why does addiction cause such constant lying and how does one call out these lies with compassion? recently, i had to terminate an employee who i discovered was stealing from my organization. i had suspected for some time that he was struggling with addiction, but i kept second guessing my instincts and, as a result, the theft from my organization continued. \n\nthis employee appeared to be struggling with constant personal crises and asked for various accommodations at work to deal with these. over the course of his three months of employment, his mother, two of his children and he himself all had various medical emergencies that had to be dealt with. he never worked a full week, without leaving early or taking personal days, in order to deal with various personal issues. when he signed the contract, he very honestly disclosed that he had been sober for three years. but in the following months, that timeline shifted -- three years turned into two and two years turned into celebrating his first year anniversary of sobriety. \n\nsome mornings at work, he would seem very down and lethargic. by the afternoon, he would sometimes be hyperactive -- talking quickly with lots of big plans and ideas, he would be jumpy and frenetic, bursting with energy. he was the only member of my staff team who would drive away during his 1-hour lunch break nearly every day. he was often penniless within a few days of getting his pay cheque and on one occasion, he asked me for a nearly $1,000 advance, claiming that one of his kids had a chronic medical condition requiring medication that his insurance suddenly stopped covering. i couldn't give him an advance from the company, but i felt so badly, that i gave him $200 of my own money. \n\nultimately, i discovered that he was stealing from us -- both cash and selling some of our company's equipment and belongings online. he denied everything, but not at all convincingly, especially in light of security video footage that i have. i terminated him and he left in a very emotional, aggrieved state. \n\ni feel immensely sad for him. he threw away a really good job with benefits and he's clearly struggling with addiction. i second guessed my instincts for very long, but couldn't any longer. the compulsion to lie constantly is just staggering to me. this is the first time i come across something like this and i'll admit that i'm floored.

        "content": "my (30) fiance (27) overdosed and passed away, please help me understand what was going on with him. hi, this is going to be a painful story for me to share, but i'm really struggling to put together the pieces of the last few months before my fiance (nicholas) passed away. we have a daughter (may) who is only 9 months old. nicholas had struggled with addiction for many years and passed away a month ago. i am beyond heartbroken, i'm feeling 100 feelings at once, but i'm doing what i can to be the best mom i can for may.\n\ni understand addiction is a disease, it's not the addiction in itself that i need clarity on, but the symptoms of his using and his behaviors in the last few months before he died leave me with a lot of questions about what he was using and what was going on with his mental state. i'm hoping maybe someone can shed some light on the events leading up to his death.\n\nnicholas was an amazing dad when may was born. he was helpful, he loved to cuddle her and play songs for her on her guitar. when she was 2-3 months old, something changed. he started to have extreme delusions and paranoia. for a few months he had been working on solving the riemann hypothesis--it started as just something he'd do in his spare time (he was really smart and good at math), but then became obsessive. he would try to talk to me about it for hours, eventually getting to the point where he believed he created a quantum computer that could explain time and space. when i couldn't pay attention (because i was taking care of a newborn) he would get extremely irritated. \n\nhe stopped helping with may completely, we were living on the opposite coast of both of our families, so i was working full-time from home and taking care of our daughter 24/7 by myself. nicholas had other delusions as well--he was working as a substance abuse counselor for veterans and started to believe the hospital was doing experiments on the clients. he ended up losing that job and got a different one working for a non-profit that was supposed to be helping flood victims--then he started thinking there was a major flood coming that the government knew about and was hiding from us.\n\nnicholas got paranoid about his family, he stopped talking to them and told me a bunch of different things--that he had a secret twin, that his dad had been secretly selling his protected health information since he was born, etc. he wanted to uninvite them all from our wedding. nicholas had sores on his face, on his arms, and would tell me he had an incurable disease. he refused to see a doctor, he refused to see a psychiatrist. i asked him to take a drug test multiple times and he would brush it off.\n\ni tried so hard to get him to get help, to go to treatment, to tell me what was going on. the worst of the delusions was that he started to believe i was hurting our daughter--this is what ultimately led me to leave him and move back in with my parents when she was 5 months old. this is really hard for me to talk about but i feel like it's important. it started when he was watching me on the baby monitor, i had just tried to put her to sleep (she wasn't having it) and when i came out with her he took her from me and started screaming \"what were you doing to her arm!\" but i hadn't done anything...i knew at that point he was on something so i called our parents on speaker phone and got him to give her back to me and made him leave the apartment. we talked about it and he apologized, said it wouldn't happen again, that he was just a nervous dad, promised to get therapy and see a psychiatrist. then a few weeks later, he followed me into the nursery while i was putting her to sleep (it was pitch black in there) and she was breastfeeding and just nodding off on my lap and he started touching her body, touching my arms, and then out of nowhere screamed \"what are you doing to her legs! she has no muscle tonality in her legs!\". i knew it was happening again so i got up, went to the living room, called my mom, and just kept telling him to leave. he kept trying to take her from me but i just held on as tight as i could, but he would scream \"you're holding her too tight! don't walk on the tile you're going to drop her!\" it was the most horrible, terrifying, traumatic incident of my life and the next day i my dad fly out and he helped me move home with my daughter. nicholas' mom also flew out and was there to help him go to treatment, but he refused. throughout all of this i had called the police multiple times, the final time they were able to get him sent to the psych ward but he left within hours of being there and walked miles with no shoes on back to our apartment. \n\nafter i moved home, i convinced him to move back in with his family which is in a different state than where i am but on the same coast. he got a job working at a restaurant. he would call me often and would tell me he knows i wouldn't hurt may, that he was sorry, but i still felt like something was off. he wouldn't tell me what happened beyond that he took something \"a few times\" and had \"post-acute stress disorder.\" but i couldn't let him back into our lives until i knew what had happened and that he had gotten help, was on meds, was in aa, etc. from what he was telling me he was doing good, but i couldn't trust him and i didn't believe that he was sober. he overdosed about a month after he moved home--the police confiscated 2 bags of white powder and i saw pictures of what looked like cocaine residue on his desk but the autopsy results still haven't come back yet.\n\ni guess what i'm looking for here is for someone to tell me what he may have been using and if what i described sounds like psychosis? or some kind of schizo-affective disorder? i had seen nicholas when he was using over the years, he primarily relapsed on opiates, but what i saw after our daughter was born was not the same. he was a completely different person. when he was talking about his delusions, he 100% believed them. he would look at me and i knew he believed 100% that i was hurting may and that was the scariest, saddest part for me. \n\ni really, really loved him and to watch him turn into someone i didn't know right before my eyes was horrible. i am so sad for myself, his family, and most of all our daughter. i am angry at him, so angry, and i just want to understand what he was going through and how he got so far away from the nicholas i agreed to marry and have a baby with. i hope this is the right place to post this.",

wouldn\u2019t i do whatever it takes to save him? instead, i sit in the wreckage, pretending we\u2019re okay, knowing we\u2019re not. knowing that every hit we take, every dollar spent, every day that passes, we are closer to the end.\n\nand it\u2019s not just him.\nit\u2019s me too.\n\nit\u2019s me watching myself waste away.\nit\u2019s me knowing exactly what i\u2019m doing to my body, to my mind, to my life, and still doing it anyway.\nit\u2019s me losing people\u2014pushing away the good ones, letting them slip through my fingers like they were never real to begin with.\n\ni know that better than anyone.\nbecause i\u2019ve already done it before.\n\ni did it to someone who meant everything to me.\nfive and a half years with him, and i let meth take me away.\ni didn\u2019t even mean to. it happened so fucking slowly, so quietly, until one day, i just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there anymore.\n\nand he waited.\nevery night, he waited.\nalone.\n\nand then, when he finally stopped waiting, he came to see me.\nnot to fight. not to yell. but to prove to himself what he already knew.\nthat if i wanted to come back, i would have.\nand he was right.\n\nso he broke up with me.\nnot angrily. not dramatically. just\u2026 sadly. like he had already mourned me before i was even gone.\nand then he bought me a beer.\nhugged me.\nwatched me walk away, sobbing.\n\neven though i had already been growing feelings for someone else, that didn\u2019t erase what i felt for him.\ni still love him.\ni just\u2026 loved meth more.\n\ni told myself that this new place was something different. that this new person was something different. that maybe if i ran far enough, i could outrun the guilt, the shame, the addiction eating me alive.\n\nbut all i did was sink deeper.\n\nthis new person was never supposed to be more than a friend.\nand then he was.\nbecause i saw him suffering, i saw people taking from him, using him, leaving him alone in a bedroom to rot while they took his money and fed him more drugs.\nand i thought, i can save him.\ni thought, i can be the one person who doesn\u2019t do that to him.\nbut instead, i became just another person in the cycle.\n\nbecause no matter how much i try, i\u2019m still using with him.\nno matter how much i beg him to take his insulin, to drink water, to take care of himself, i am still sitting right there, getting high with him.\n\nand then, when i drink, it gets even worse.\nbecause when i drink, i get angry.\nand i hate it. i fucking hate it.\ni don\u2019t want to argue with him. i don\u2019t want to fight. but we do.\nbecause when i drink, i lash out.\nand when i lash out, he pushes back.\n\nand we\u2019re just tearing each other apart.\n\nand then, just six days ago, my grandma called me.\nshe told me she has breast cancer.\n\nand i broke.\ni sobbed. i told her i loved her.\nbut when she started telling me the details\u2014how big the tumor is, how bad it might be\u2014i cut her off.\ni told her i was crying too hard. that i needed a minute.\nand i hung up.\n\nand now, all i can think is:\nhow fucking selfish am i?\nhow dare i make this about me, when she\u2019s the one who\u2019s sick?\nwhen she\u2019s the one who has to actually fight for her life?\n\ni hate myself for it.\n\nand i know, deep down, she probably doesn\u2019t think of it like that. she probably understands.\nbut i can\u2019t shake the feeling that i failed her, just like i fail everyone else.\n\nand that\u2019s just it.\n\nthat\u2019s the core of all of this.\n\ni am failing everyone.\ni failed him.\ni am failing my boyfriend.\ni am failing my grandmother.\ni am failing myself.\n\nand i don\u2019t know how to stop.\n\ni want to.\ngod, i want to.\ni don\u2019t want to wake up like this anymore.\ni don\u2019t want to watch the person i love waste away.\ni don\u2019t want to be this person who burns everything he touches.\n\nbut every time i think about stopping, about actually taking that first step, i just\u2026\ncan\u2019t.\n\nand i don\u2019t even know why.\n\nmaybe i\u2019m afraid.\nmaybe i don\u2019t think i deserve to get better.\nmaybe i\u2019ve just been doing this for so long that i don\u2019t know how to exist without it.\n\nbut i know one thing.\ni can\u2019t keep going like this.\nbecause if i do, one of us is going to die.\n\nand i don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be him first, or me first, or both of us together.\n\nbut i know that if i don\u2019t figure out how to stop,\nthis ends in a funeral.\n\nand i don\u2019t want that.\ni don\u2019t.\n\nso please.\nwhoever is listening.\nhelp me figure out how to want to save myself.\n\nbecause i swear, i am trying.\ni am trying so fucking hard.\n\nand i am losing.\n\n\u2014 me",

(off topic but caramel coffee creamer tastes exactly like what i though butterbeer from harry potter would taste like as a kid.) for some reason the sweet tooth has gotten much worse now. i\u2019m an adult btw.\n\ni dont even care if i get diabetes at this point. \n\nedit: i didn\u2019t realize this subreddit was specifically for drugs or life-altering addictions! sorry if this bothers anyone :)",

        "content": "how to fight the addiction? my problem may be complex hello everyone.\n\nmy name is greg, i am 30 years old and i am diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and depression. as i'm in remission (since 2019 i had only one small relapse, i'm on meds), i very rarely hear any voices, what i experience i would call schizophrenia-induced anhedonia, depression (it's better than few months ago though) and very mild \"delusions\" (a feeling that other people are speaking about me behind my back, even strangers, because i live in a small town where people usually know each other).\n\ni don't have a stable job. since the beginning of 2024 i am looking for a job as a cctv operator or a cleaner but unfortunately i didn't have luck and there's always something stepping into my way. they don't call back, they don't answer the phone or they don't want to hire me because of my illness (in poland mental illnesses are taboo and there's a huge stigma). ofcourse whenever it's possible, i try to hide it before other people. i work illegally in distribution of leaflets but the pay is very low. but it's still better than nothing.\n\nsince 2023 i'm addicted to **mephedrone**, the substance in effects is similar to speed, mdma or coke. it's very addictive, i got addicted in just one month of regular usage and now it has been almost 2 years of being addicted to this sh\\*t. my life is a total ruin, i don't have any friends left, i have a huge debt in a bank (and it's growing), i don't have a normal, stable job and i live with my parents at home.\n\nmy family don't even speak to me (for many people it may be very strange), they don't support me, they just complain that i eat a lot and they need to spend a lot of money to pay my debt (which is true). i need to fight the addiction almost on my own...\n\nis anyone here who won with the addiction being in a similar situation? usually i take drugs when i encounter some trigger. it may be a place, a person, or anything else connected with drugs. sometimes i also take mephedrone to not think about my life (i'm depressed).\n\nplease, consider your situation, compare your situation to mine and give me some advice.\n\nhave a nice day in this crazy world...\n\ni really want to be sober forever...\n\nps i had a lot of problems with my family and other people, i was also heartbroken and i had a genius idea that i will take drugs for one month to forget and i will be good. drugs are with me until now. don't do drugs, ever,",

        "content": "all it took was one hit, i still struggle 9 months later i feel so stupid right now. last year one the last day of my freshmen year of highschool i traded a can of monster for a vape. i was curious, and had been told it helps with anxiety which i have a lot of. i took it home which led to me vapeing for the first time. i liked it, i liked it a lot. the feeling, the taste, the everything. i told my friends about it and they got really upset with me and made me take a video of myself throwing it away. so i did, i value my friends more then a vape, right? well i then began to crave it, really badly. it was all i was capable of thinking about and that began to scare me shitless. my mom was never one to get addicted to that stuff, so i thought i'd be fine. i hadn't taken into account my dad's crippling drug addiction, which ultimately probably played into the fact i was hooked on vaping immediately. it was bad at first, the craving. it sucked like hell. its been 9 months, and i thought i was fine now, i wasn't randomly craving it. but then yesterday me and my 2 best friends were at a gas station, and it had vapes on display for sale. i found myself eyeing them the entire time we were inside. i felt to weak and upset at the moment for wanting it so bad. i didn't think that one decision, that one hit would continue to haunt me for this long. i just want to give into to the feeling again but i can't and i don't know who to talk to about it. every time i see a vape it takes so much self control not to ask for a hit and i hate it. i hate this.",

        "content": "need advice. i am 58 days clean from pornography addiction. im a 31 year old man and this is the most difficult thing i\u2019ve ever dealt with in my life so far.\n\na little backstory, i was a teenager when i started really having easy access to watching porn so naturally it became a problem early on and my brain of course got hooked on the dopamine fix that i would give it every day. i decided to finally really quit in december right before i lost my job, got a new one the very next day and also had to move back into my mom\u2019s place. safe to say life was uprooted and it all spiraled into really bad anxiety and panic attacks. \n\nthroughout all of this i have had so many \u2018ah-ha!\u2019 moments that have reassured me that this all will pass but i keep getting caught in the vicious cycle of anxiety and fear over all my symptoms. \n\nive done a lot of research and watched many youtube videos about the withdrawals and how quitting cold turkey is basically a dopamine detox. i honestly unknowingly just hurdled myself into that i think and i\u2019m still feeling it. i know the brain has to build new neural pathways and adjust to the serious decrease in dopamine before i start to feel normal again. but good lord.. every day i just feel so off and so foggy and anxious and have ruminating thoughts about if this is actually what\u2019s going on with me.\n\nbefore all this i of course felt just fine but that\u2019s because i was using porn every day as my crutch right? ive dealt with anxiety and panic before a few years ago but never like this. i have ativan to take as needed but i have this whole thing about it this time around that makes me feel like it\u2019s just a band-aid and it only puts everything on hold for 6-8 hours.\n\nyesterday, i decided to go check out a place that focuses on addiction and recovery of all kinds and i spoke to the ceo of the company for 2 hours for a consult to see if i would be right for it. keep in mind this is the first place i visited for outside professional help to get through this, she talked to me a lot about trauma and how i \u201chave it\u201d but before hearing any of that from her, nothing in my past or childhood ever really bothered me. i had a weird gut feeling before going into this place because it just seemed weird that they are pushing the trauma thing so hard. seemed like they were trying to get me to pay for the program which would be $3500 out of pocket.\n\ni left the place feeling pretty good but when i got home and told my mom about it she basically said those places are too expensive and they use the trauma thing to try to reel you in and make you feel like you really have something wrong with you. so at this point i just don\u2019t know who to trust, who to talk to and where to go. im struggling so badly with all this, i\u2019m not afraid of relapsing i just want to get through the withdrawal phase and feel normal again..\n\nif there\u2019s anyone here on this page who has dealt with something like this i would really appreciate some insight or advice on where to go with this. thank you and much love.",

        "content": "9 months pregnant, addict boyfriend pregnant, boyfriend addict\n\ni am currently nine months pregnant with my first child. i hadn\u2019t been with my boyfriend long before getting pregnant (4 months).\ni found out he was using cocaine around the same time i found out i was pregnant and it\u2019s gotten progressively worse through the pregnancy.\n\nhe is a (popular) actor in his home country and he went back in september to film a tv show (he insisted he didn\u2019t want to go but he\u2019s broke and needed money to support the baby). this wrapped in december. it is now february, i have a scheduled c section in 10 days and he\u2019s still not here.\n\nhe has been partying since he got there. goes days without calling me. on the find my phone app i can see him spending all night- until ten am- in random residences. when he\u2019s there he declines my calls. then calls me two days later like nothing is wrong. \n\nhe\u2019s gotten progressively meaner. whenever i have an issue or am emotional he can\u2019t handle it and just tells me to go wake up my mom, etc. he told me i \u2018act like the only woman on earth who\u2019s ever been pregnant\u2019.\n\nhis instagram posts have been weird and offensive. to the point that my family and friends have noticed and when i ask him to take them down he says we\u2019re overreacting or taking them out of context. he has followed women there and liked their \u2018thirst trappy\u2019 photos. \n\nhe\u2019s always either drunk or high on coke. if he\u2019s high on coke he knows i know so he just avoids me for days.\n\ni have consistently told him i won\u2019t put up with it anymore but he keeps saying when he gets back hell go to rehab, etc.\n\nafter being absent the whole pregnancy he\u2019s recently forbidden the name i\u2019ve chosen and told me our baby can\u2019t get the hen b vaccine. it\u2019s so upsetting and weird.\n\ni\u2019m completely done. i don\u2019t ever want to see him again and i don\u2019t want him anywhere near this baby. he\u2019s broke, in debt. can\u2019t support him. i- on the other hand- have money and can and want to be the sole provider of this baby. my family are fully supportive and have done everything for me and this baby. \n\ni just don\u2019t know what to do in terms of parental rights, etc. his stuff is in my apartment. he insists he\u2019s coming any day (once the money from the sale of his mom\u2019s apartment comes through). but it\u2019s stretched weeks. \nthe money from the tv show has seemingly disappeared. he says it hasn\u2019t come yet but i have a hunch he\u2019s spent it all already. \n\nif he does show up he will be germy fresh off a plane expecting to see my newborn baby? he also won\u2019t have his necessary tdap vaccine and he\u2019s so arrogant he will try and get away with it.\n\ni have anxiety about the potential of him coming. i don\u2019t want him near me when i\u2019m having surgery and i don\u2019t want to put his name on his birth certificate.\n\nbasically i just want to know what my rights are? any advice? i\u2019m sure i\u2019ve left so much out but its just been so exhausting.\n\ni\u2019m afraid he\u2019s just a pathological liar (which goes hand in hand with addiction) who has fully taken advantage of my decent financial standing and just expects me to put up with it because he\u2019s a handsome movie star type. i feel so taken advantage of and sad. but mostly scared for my baby. this drug use is serious and dangerous and i need him to stay away.

        "content": "day 5-advice for all/ 3rd repost as all other reddit forums hate truth i\u2019ve been spending a lot of time in this reddit.\n\nhere are something\u2019s i\u2019d like to share my perspective on. \n\n1. quit for yourself no one else, if you outsource your discipline your just waiting/creating the opportunity to smoke so you feel less pressure. that pressure is your teacher, that pressure is the lesson. it\u2019s the cause and effect.\n\n2. depending on your abuse (i could kill a oz in 2 days, a cart in a day to 3 days max) \nprogress is progress. take every angle, start by extending the time between smokes. then gradually break habits. like waiting to smoke first thing in the morning, wait 30 min. then a hour, then 2. same with before bed. \n\ni\u2019ve said this before here. but quitting is like going to the gym. you don\u2019t expect to go to the gym and start lifting 300lbs of the rack and just start pumping iron.\nslow and steady wins the race.\n\n3.hydration and food.\ni\u2019ve personally noticed that alot of my anxiety and stressed linked to this. \ni\u2019ll have a panic attack and eat and feel much better. personally i have seen others talk about drinking smoothies and easy to eat things. i feel like failed at this and have felt the negatives please take care of yourself. \n\n4. you vs addict you\nwhat do i mean? well the voice in your head that says \u201cone more time\u201d\ni\u2019ve quit a few drugs a few times (nothing hard)that being said they all have one thing in common. it\u2019s what i call the deals with the devil. the easiest way to describe these moments is like having the lil demon and angel on each shoulder. if you\u2019ve watch emperor new groove. sometimes the angel gets stuck in traffic. sometimes that lil devil is very convincing, don\u2019t be tempted. \nyou\u2019ll only make the goal of quitting harder or even potentially give up. don\u2019t reset the timer/don\u2019t extend it. \nthis is probably one of the hardest parts as an addict. slips happen, but be hard on yourself but at the same time accepting. it sounds backwards but you need to feel that pain of hurting yourself so you don\u2019t forget you\u2019re hurting yourself. don\u2019t chase a \u201cfix\u201d. \n\n\n5. know i love you. i don\u2019t know you but i love you. god/whatever has put us on this path together. you are not alone, reach out to others  even myself if need be. i\u2019m not a saint i speak from failure, i speak from experience. i was always \u201ctop stoner\u201d in my friend group watching my friends chase to be like me has done nothing but fill me with pain knowing i lead them to hell. i watched how everyone around me growing up 24yrs old has been sold this idea about weed as was i.\nwe were on mass manipulated. we are examples. so let\u2019s be good ones for our future prospects, spread the truth. \n\n6. last thing.\nall drugs lead to the highway of hell. \n\nthis is how i\u2019ve personally found and seen in my life. \n\nevery drug leads to the highway of hell. we all have different on-ramps, maybe carpooling with our friends. some are in fast cars some are in slower cars, some stick to their lane. some try out others. some crash and some of us thankfully have the opportunity to realize where we are heading before we get there and are faced with the choice to turn around and face our decision to go down this road.\nbut the only way to go is backwards and you must face yourself. you\u2019ll see so many of \u201cyou\u201d on your path back. facing the decisions you\u2019ve made on this road.\nyou\u2019ll also have to follow the rules of the road on the way back and the one to hell has no rules. \nsometimes on the way home you\u2019ll get stuck in traffic as everyone wants to go home. but just remember this is part of the process. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nreddit is weird on the phone so sorry if i just rambled a bit tried to go back and fix things and it just won\u2019t let me lol.\neither way this is part of my process if quitting. using time to help others and help myself.\nbut i hope by posting this i can turn people towards my profile without having to reach one person at a time. \n\ngoodmorning, goodluck. i love yall",

        "content": "withdrawal from medication so i got clean from a few stimulants many years ago. while getting off them, and because i was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder, they prescribed me antipsychotics to \u201chelp with the withdrawal\u201d. if you are struggling right now, and getting ready to go through withdrawal, i am about to give you the best advice of your life. if you go to a rehab, or get help from a doctor, and they offer you meds to help you with withdrawal, do not take them. unless it is meds to safeguard your life, like if you\u2019re detoxing from something where the withdrawal could kill you, it is never the right move to take a medication to make the withdrawal easier, because whatever med they give you to \u201cmake it easier\u201d, it will cause you way more problems and the withdrawal to get off that med will be a million times worse than what you initially were getting off of. it\u2019s like the worst investment in the world, where you always lose. getting off antipsychotics can permanently fuck you up. getting off these now, even as someone with no psychotic disorder, is already proving to be worrying. the reason i now need to get off them is because they are skyrocketing my hormones, messing up my body, causing pains, anxiety, hallucinations, risk of cancer, fatigue, among other issues. the withdrawal after two days has been night terrors, personality changes, anxiety, depersonalization, dissociation, basically, way worse than the initial withdrawal i was trying to avoid by taking them. do not start unneeded meds because of fear. i beg you. i mean it\u2019s your life, but i know far too many people who get stuck in this trap, and have their lives ruined by psychosis or other psychiatric issues getting off these. i\u2019m lucky i have great mental health now, so fingers crossed. stay safe everyone. happy valentine\u2019s day, hug your loved ones and stay healthy.

        "content": "3+ years sober and counting hey, everyone. as the title states, i've been sober for over 3 years. before that, i was shooting both meth and heroin. \n\nwhen i started using, i was an alcoholic. i was in a dark and lonely place. i had recently left a guy who i had moved from illinois to arizona with. we had been together for 4-5 years (my longest relationship). \n\nthe first time i tried meth and heroin (yes, i did both on the same night), i was having a particularly rough day. a new friend (who i started dating soon after--we'll call him rick) invited me over to hang out with him. he was smoking clear and black off a foil and invited me to try them out. i was drunk and didn't gaf, so i said yes. \n\nwithin a month, i was using rigs. within a year, the veins in my arms were beginning to shrivel up and become useless. even now, with 3 years of abstinence, the veins in my arms are basically trash. drawing blood at the doctor's office is a fun little \"challenge\" for the rns. my fingers go numb all the time from poor circulation. \n\nrick was a narcissist, emotionally abusive, and used drugs to control me. he always held our supply, never shared our plug's info with me, and literally kept me locked in the apartment with a camera facing me when he left. there are plenty of stories i could tell about rick, but that's not why i'm here. \n\nafter the covid quarantine lifted, we lost our unemployment bonuses and ended up homeless. we managed to stay off the streets and lived in some really seedy motels for many months by begging family members for money (that we obviously never paid back). my parents had no clue i was using because they lived in colorado and i'd honestly never done anything like that before. i was a good kid growing up, so they had no reason not to trust me. \n\neventually things came to a head and they stopped sending me money. we were going to be on the streets any day now and rick had become physically abusive. the sweetness he used to show me on occasion to keep me attached to him had stopped. so i finally reached out for help. \n\ni called my parents and told them i needed to come home. they had suspected for awhile that my relationship with rick was toxic, but they had no clue how bad it really was. i am grateful every day for my parents because they basically dropped everything and drove out to az to get me. i didn't tell rick for obvious reasons. \n\nthe day they arrived is when they found out about my habit. my mom saw a needle on the floor and asked if it was mine. i couldn't even look her in the eye when i nodded my head to say yes. she didn't care though. they helped pack up my things as i dealt with rick, who was sobbing dramatically, trying to guilt me into staying. before i left, he made sure to get my debit card to withdraw any remaining funds we had (there was $30 on the card). \n\ni explained to my parents that i'd be experiencing some pretty major withdrawal symptoms within a couple of hours. they needed to rest before getting back onto the road, so we stopped at a hotel first. that night was the worst. i had experienced heroin withdrawal before, but knowing that it was gonna get worse while sitting in the backseat of a truck was terrifying. \n\nthe next morning, i begged my mom to pick up some kratom from a smoke shop before we headed out. i had no clue if it was going to help much, but it was worth a shot. within a few hours of taking it, i was feeling semi-normal, but incredibly depressed--probably from the meth withdrawal. \n\nthat was all i needed to get home and once i was there, i slept for days. i was also recovering from a back injury, caused by a tussle i had with rick only a couple days before i left az. i lived in a recliner for 2 months, getting up only to walk to and from the bathroom, or to go to doctor's appointments. it was the worst pain i've ever experienced. i could barely walk, even with crutches. \n\nonce my back was better, i got a job working at a doggy daycare. it was the perfect place for me to be as i continued my healing and sobriety journey. i used to sob quietly where none of my coworkers could see while petting those sweet angels. they helped me heal in ways i can't even describe. i still work there now and i've been promoted to assistant manager. i absolutely love my job and it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. \n\nanyways, i wanted to share my story so that anyone who's still in active addiction can see that the dark days do get a little better. i still have a lot of healing and growing to do, but i'm working on being grateful for what i have. posting here is helping me to do just that. thank you for reading, and i'm hopeful that if i can stop using, so can you. \n\ntl;dr: i was shooting h and meth for 2 years with a narcissistic abuser, was homeless for a few months, and dealt with a severe back injury that took away my ability to walk; but now i'm 3 years sober and an assistant manager at a doggy daycare. you can do it too!

(even witnessed sexual harassment and assault, its like a goddamned frathouse.) i would expect people in recovery to be less judgemental and vile. the problem is i keep hearing we gotta \"keep the brotherhood going\" and im worried if i dont contact people i will relapse. but like 95 percent of these people i just cant ever imagine wanting to contact again after i get out. any idea how i can find some people more similar to me in recovery?",

        "content": "do i need to go to rehab/hospital? please understand that people struggle with different addictions and react differently to different substances. if you\u2019re going to leave a stupid remark like baiting please go find something else to do with your life than putting random strangers down. having said that i need advice. for the past 3 weeks to a month i have been drinking an average of 60-80 red bulls a week. i realise this might sound a lot to some people and some might think i\u2019m over exaggerating and they feel the need to tell me i\u2019m faking or leave a negative comment but it\u2019s the truth. addiction manifests itself in different ways. furthermore going back to my point i have tried quitting the last week and i feel absolutely sick. i\u2019m vomitting my teeth hurt my lips are cut up i have mouth ulcers everywhere i keep switching moods rapidly i get the shakes my headaches are very bad i can\u2019t sleep. etc.. i drank another 12 in a row a couple of hours ago and i feel normal again. i feel tweaked up but normal. i don\u2019t know how to exist this cycle. what should i do? has this reached the point of rehab? should i be be honest with my father about what\u2019s happening to me? i mean obviously o should but how can i avoid what\u2019s happening with me when i stop?

        "content": "stopped oxy - insane depression i have been on an off small doses (10-40 mg a day) of instant release oxycodone these past 6 months. purely for pleasure, i have no pain issues. \n\ni have had break days and even took a three week break a while ago. which was fine, as i knew i would get some more from my doctor when i wanted. now i have used all of that prescription (faster than ever) and my doctor will not prescribe more. which is understandable if i take his perspective. i figured that i might as well take a looong break or even quit. keeping up the (ab)use will lead to norhing good. \n\nanyhow, i have been without any oxy for 3 days now. physically i feel ok. some stomach cramps, headache, runny/stuffy nose, irregular body temp and mild insomnia. all withdrawal symptoms, i understand, but nothing too uncomfortable (feels like a flu, and i have lived through plenty of those). \n\nhowever\u2026 since waking up on monday realizing i may never have the pleasure of popping 20mg oxy and feel the calm and euphoria onset again, i have been incredibly sad. depressed. absolutely devastated. feels like someone i knew have passed. if i had known that i would get more in a couple of weeks, i think i would have been fine (but the cycle would have just continued and i know i need to stop before this gets really serious\u2026). \n\ni guess writing this out feels good. but i also have a question. this bottomless depression and craving, how long will it last? i know my abuse has been pretty short term compared to many, and that i have nothing to feel sorry about compared to many, but this depression is making it hard to get through the days\u2026. considering my dosage has been pretty low and the abuse pretty short term, do you think this depression and anxiety will subside soon? or will it be years\u2026?\n\ni am doing ketamine assisted psychotherapy for depression btw. the treatment i had yesterday (third one), with a xanax to calm me (nervous for the ketamine experience) and 1,25 mg/kg injection, really elevated my mood and repressed the physical withdrawal symptoms today, but now i feel them creeping up on me again. its like my normal depression (which i have had for years), but on steroids. it was not like this in my break-from-oxy days and weeks. these are pure bestial cravings\u2026\n\ni guess i just wanted to get this off my chest and ask if i can any expect tonget better soon. if not i might try to get some more oxy from my doctor to taper off - but as i am experiencing more psycological symptoms rather than physical withdrawal issues, i am not sure that will help. \n\ni am just so sad\u2026",

        "content": "just an addict i came to the realization yesterday that the \u201cbig secret\u201d i\u2019ve been holding from myself and the people in my life is that i\u2019m an addict. it doesn\u2019t matter the substance, if it has any addictive qualities at all, i have an unhealthy relationship with it. it\u2019s funny looking back and realizing that i\u2019ve actually somehow known this about myself since i was very young. i used to make comments all the time saying that i could never get into drinking , drugs, or smoking because i have an \u201caddictive personality\u201d. how i had that intuition about myself as a child, i\u2019ll never know. but i should\u2019ve listened to her, because here i am now.\n\ni think it\u2019s been an easy thing for me to hide because i\u2019m still able to function in my everyday life. i can look and act like i have my shit together when it matters most. i can rationalize to myself all day, and convince other people, that i\u2019m not really an addict, because if i was i would be much worse off than i am. i watch shows like intervention and think, \u201csee, these are addicts \u2014 at least i\u2019m not dying or living in the street!\u201d\n\nat the same time, whenever i watch shows or hear stories like that, there\u2019s an uncomfortable battle raging inside me that knows i\u2019m exactly like them, and the only thing keeping me afloat, really, is the support i\u2019ve received from family and the fortunate fact that i\u2019ve avoided ever trying \u201charder\u201d substances. i find myself having emotional reactions to these people\u2019s stories because i empathize with them. i root for their recovery, but meanwhile do nothing to help myself.\n\nthat needs to change. i\u2019ve taken steps towards improving my mental health in general, but i know all that will be futile unless i can finally admit to myself that my addictions are ruining my life. every time i drink or use substances, the thought of, \u201cone day you\u2019re going to have to give this up\u201d creeps in and it feels like legitimate mourning. it\u2019s going to be the hardest to stop things like drinking, when so many activities in my life seem to revolve around it and as someone with social anxiety it seems impossible to be outgoing and relate to other people without using alcohol as a crutch. \n\nwhen i\u2019m feeling bad, i use substances as self medication. when i\u2019m feeling good, i think, \u201cbeing totally trashed and out of control would make this feel even better\u201d. i\u2019ve worked my addictions into every aspect of my life. i\u2019m scared to quit because it\u2019s hard to imagine finding any joy in life without being buzzed on something. i\u2019m afraid of what the people in my life might say. i\u2019m afraid of how sick and irritated i\u2019m going to feel when i quit these things i\u2019ve grown so dependent on. i think back to some of the best moments in my life, realize i was intoxicated when they happened, and convince myself that being intoxicated is what made it so good. i forget all the bad parts. i forget how addiction feels heavy and constricting, and all the times i\u2019ve quietly known it\u2019s what\u2019s holding me back from reaching my truest potential.\n\nposting here is my first step. i don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take or what kind of help i\u2019ll need, i don\u2019t know the impact quitting will have on my social life, but i know i need to step up for myself for once and take action.\n",
